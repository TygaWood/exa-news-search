    "text": "OpenAI is rolling out a feature called “Projects” to ChatGPT. It’s basically a folder system that makes it easier to organize things you’re working on while using the AI chatbot.  As shown in a demo video, your list of Projects will show up in the sidebar. If you make a new project, you can do things like edit the title, set a color for the project’s icon, and add files as well as instructions to tailor how ChatGPT responds to things in that individual project. You can also add previous chats to your project to keep track of them. The new feature seems like a pretty useful way to keep track of, for lack of a better word, your projects. During the demo video, an OpenAI employee showed examples of how they use Projects to plan for a Secret Santa gift exchange and for home maintenance. Depending on your needs, it could be a better way to work on a project than my usual method, which is dumping everything I can think of into an Apple Note. Projects is rolling out today to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Teams users. It will come to free users “as soon as possible” and to Enterprise and Edu users “early in the new year,” according to OpenAI CPO Kevin Weil.   Projects was announced as Day 7 of OpenAI’s 12 days of “ship-mas.” Previous announcements included the release of the Sora video generator, ChatGPT’s Canvas view, and the $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro subscription.",

When the feature is available to you, you can try it out with new Audio Overviews. (It won’t work with old ones.) Here’s how, according to a blog post:   Create a new Audio Overview. Tap the new Interactive mode (BETA) button. While listening, tap “Join.” A host will call on you. Ask your question. The hosts will respond with a personalized answer based on your sources. After answering, they’ll resume the original Audio Overview.   The ability to actually talk with NotebookLM seems like a potentially useful way to learn more about what you’ve collected in the app. But Google cautions that it’s an “experimental feature” and that “hosts may also pause awkwardly before responding or occasionally introduce inaccuracies,” so it may not be a totally polished experience to start.  In addition to the interactive Audio Overviews, Google is introducing a new interface for NotebookLM that organizes things into three areas: a “sources” panel for your information, a “chat” panel to talk with an AI chatbot about the sources, and a “studio” panel that lets you make things like Audio Overviews and Study Guides.

    "text": "OpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a “new telemetry service” gone awry. \nOn Wednesday, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT; its video generator, Sora; and its developer-facing API experienced major disruptions starting at around 3 p.m. Pacific. OpenAI acknowledged the problem soon after — and began working on a fix. But it’d take the company roughly three hours to restore all services.\nIn a postmortem published late Thursday, OpenAI wrote that the outage wasn’t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by a telemetry service it deployed Wednesday to collect Kubernetes metrics. Kubernetes is an open source program that helps manage containers, or packages of apps and related files that are used to run software in isolated environments.\n“Telemetry services have a very wide footprint, so this new service’s configuration unintentionally caused … resource-intensive Kubernetes API operations,” OpenAI wrote in the postmortem. “[Our] Kubernetes API servers became overwhelmed, taking down the Kubernetes control plane in most of our large [Kubernetes] clusters.”\nThat’s a lot of jargon, but basically, the new telemetry service affected OpenAI’s Kubernetes operations, including a resource that many of the company’s services rely on for DNS resolution. DNS resolution converts IP addresses to domain names; it’s the reason you’re able to type “Google.com” instead of “142.250.191.78.”\nOpenAI’s use of DNS caching, which holds info about previously-looked-up domain names (like website addresses) and their corresponding IP addresses, complicated matters by “delay[ing] visibility,” OpenAI wrote, and “allowing the rollout [of the telemetry service] to continue before the full scope of the problem was understood.”\nOpenAI says that it was able to detect the issue “a few minutes” before customers ultimately started seeing an impact, but that it wasn’t able to quickly implement a fix because it had to work around the overwhelmed Kubernetes servers. \n“This was a confluence of multiple systems and processes failing simultaneously and interacting in unexpected ways,” the company wrote. “Our tests didn’t catch the impact the change was having on the Kubernetes control plane [and] remediation was very slow because of the locked-out effect.”\nOpenAI says that it’ll adopt several measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, including improvements to phased rollouts with better monitoring for infrastructure changes and new mechanisms to ensure OpenAI engineers can access the company’s Kubernetes API servers in any circumstances.\n“We apologize for the impact that this incident caused to all of our customers – from ChatGPT users to developers to businesses who rely on OpenAI products,” OpenAI wrote. “We’ve fallen short of our own expectations.”\nMost Popular\n \nKyle Wiggers is a senior reporter at TechCrunch with a special interest in artificial intelligence.

    "text": "The lawsuit between Elon Musk and OpenAI is really heating up. OpenAI just dropped a new blog post defending itself against Musk that outlines some new text messages between cofounders Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and former board member Shivon Zilis. “You can’t sue your way to AGI,” the OpenAI blog post reads, referring to artificial general intelligence, which Altman has promised soon. “We have great respect for Elon’s accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAl, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom. It is critical for the U.S. to remain the global leader in Al. Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, and we have been and will remain a mission-driven organization. We hope Elon shares that goal, and will uphold the values of innovation and free market competition that have driven his own success.” The blog highlights Musk’s attempts to maneuver into the CEO position and gain majority control of the company (though it adds that on one call Musk said he “didn’t care about equity” but “just needed to accumulate $80B for a city on Mars”). Musk also proposed that OpenAI spin into Tesla, which has been previously revealed. When the negotiations fell apart because OpenAI’s cofounders rejected his proposal (Brockman and Sutskever admitted they had fears of a power struggle), Musk resigned from the company. The blog said that after Musk resigned, he hosted a goodbye all-hands with the team where he encouraged them to “pursue the path we saw to raising billions per year” and that “he would pursue advanced Al research at Tesla, which was the only vehicle he believed could obtain this level of funding.” Later, around the time Musk was working to acquire Twitter, he texted Altman that he was “disturbed” to see the company’s new $20 billion valuation. “De facto. I provided almost all the seed, A and most of B round funding,” he wrote, according to the disclosed texts. “This is a bait and switch.” A few months after that interaction, Musk started an OpenAI competitor, xAI. Some of the messages published by OpenAI were previously outlined in court filings that Musk made in his ongoing suit against OpenAI and its partner Microsoft. The lawsuit, filed by Musk in March, alleges that OpenAI had strayed from its original nonprofit mission to develop AI for the public good (he withdrew it in June 2024 without explanation, then refiled in August 2024). Today’s update from OpenAI attempts to counter Musk’s narrative by offering evidence that he, not Altman, attempted to seize control in the company’s early days — a direct response to Musk’s recent lawsuit claims about Altman’s power consolidation.

The company first teased a smarter Google Assistant for the home in August and is starting with Gemini-powered answers to your general knowledge questions. The regular Google Assistant will still handle things like smart home and music requests, but you’ll hear a chime before the Assistant responds with an AI-powered answer.  As detailed by Google in a new support document, Gemini in Google Assistant on Nest speakers (that’s a branding delight right there) can answer wider-ranging questions with more in-depth answers — similar to Gemini on Android and iOS. You can also ask it follow-up questions and interrupt the response to ask another question, although you’ll still need to say “Hey Google” each time.  First spotted by 9to5Google, the Gemini-enhanced Assistant began appearing on speakers earlier this month. However, it’s only available on Nest Audio and Nest Mini (2nd gen) smart speakers — Nest smart displays or earlier generations speakers aren’t compatible. The AI-powered answers are also only open to users in Google Home’s Public Preview, who are also Nest Aware subscribers and who have opted in to Experimental AI features. However, that last option isn’t available to everyone in the Preview. As detailed in this support document, if you’re selected to use Experimental AI features, you’ll receive a notification in your Google Home App inbox. This will let you toggle on an Experimental AI features button to start testing Gemini-powered Google Assistant.   This also gets you access to the other generative AI-powered features announced in August: Gemini-powered camera search and descriptions to help you filter your Nest security camera footage (requires Nest Aware Plus) and a Help me create feature that lets you set up a Google Home routine with just a few words.  While it’s a very limited rollout, Google is still the first of the big three tech companies to publicly launch new, generative AI-powered features on its voice assistant in the smart home.

    "text": "OpenAI’s cofounder and former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, made headlines earlier this year after he left to start his own AI lab called Safe Superintelligence Inc. He has avoided the limelight since his departure but made a rare public appearance in Vancouver on Friday at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS). “Pre-training as we know it will unquestionably end,” Sutskever said onstage. This refers to the first phase of AI model development, when a large language model learns patterns from vast amounts of unlabeled data — typically text from the internet, books, and other sources.   “We’ve achieved peak data and there’ll be no more.”  During his NeurIPS talk, Sutskever said that, while he believes existing data can still take AI development farther, the industry is tapping out on new data to train on. This dynamic will, he said, eventually force a shift away from the way models are trained today. He compared the situation to fossil fuels: just as oil is a finite resource, the internet contains a finite amount of human-generated content. “We’ve achieved peak data and there’ll be no more,” according to Sutskever. “We have to deal with the data that we have. There’s only one internet.”           Ilya Sutskever calls data the “fossil fuel” of AI.  Ilya Sutskever/NeurIPS    Next-generation models, he predicted, are going to “be agentic in a real ways.” Agents have become a real buzzword in the AI field. While Sutskever didn’t define them during his talk, they are commonly understood to be an autonomous AI system that performs tasks, makes decisions, and interacts with software on its own.  Along with being “agentic,” he said future systems will also be able to reason. Unlike today’s AI, which mostly pattern-matches based on what a model has seen before, future AI systems will be able to work things out step-by-step in a way that is more comparable to thinking.    Do you work at OpenAI? I’d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com.  The more a system reasons, “the more unpredictable it becomes,” according to Sutskever. He compared the unpredictability of “truly reasoning systems” to how advanced AIs that play chess “are unpredictable to the best human chess players.” “They will understand things from limited data,” he said. “They will not get confused.” On stage, he drew a comparison between the scaling of AI systems and evolutionary biology, citing research that shows the relationship between brain and body mass across species. He noted that while most mammals follow one scaling pattern, hominids (human ancestors) show a distinctly different slope in their brain-to-body mass ratio on logarithmic scales.  He suggested that, just as evolution found a new scaling pattern for hominid brains, AI might similarly discover new approaches to scaling beyond how pre-training works today.           Ilya Sutskever compares the scaling of AI systems and evolutionary biology.  Ilya Sutskever/NeurIPS    After Sutskever concluded his talk, an audience member asked him how researchers can create the right incentive mechanisms for humanity to create AI in a way that gives it “the freedoms that we have as homosapiens.” “I feel like in some sense those are the kind of questions that people should be reflecting on more,” Sutskever responded. He paused for a moment before saying that he doesn’t “feel confident answering questions like this” because it would require a “top down government structure.” The audience member suggested cryptocurrency, which made others in the room chuckle. “I don’t feel like I am the right person to comment on cryptocurrency but there is a chance what you [are] describing will happen,” Sutskever said. “You know, in some sense, it’s not a bad end result if you have AIs and all they want is to coexist with us and also just to have rights. Maybe that will be fine... I think things are so incredibly unpredictable. I hesitate to comment but I encourage the speculation.”",
    "summary": "This article does not report on any newly released AI updates.  Instead, it discusses OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever's prediction that the way AI is built will change fundamentally.  He argues that the current reliance on massive datasets (\"pre-training\") will end because the readily available data is nearing its limit.  Future AI, he suggests, will be more \"agentic\" (autonomous and task-performing), capable of reasoning and operating with less data, similar to how human intelligence works.  The article mentions Sutskever's comparison of this shift to the evolutionary jump in brain-to-body mass ratio in hominids.  There are no specific details on new AI releases.\n"

The Verge’s Richard Lawler joins us as we discuss Google Gemini 2.0, Project Astra and Project Mariner, and everything else Google is doing to put AI in the products you already use every day. We also talk through the new Android XR announcement, and Google’s renewed commitment to making headsets and smart glasses that work. It’s all an AI story, no matter how you look at it. After that... more AI! We talk about the launch and near-immediate disappearance of OpenAI’s Sora, what’s new in iOS 18.2, Reddit’s clever-but-primitive new Answers feature, and more.  Finally, in the lightning round, it’s a smorgasbord of tech news. YouTube is big on TVs; Instagram is testing a way for you to test your posts; the TikTok ban is coming, but a sale sounds like the answer; Sonos once again made a great soundbar; and what the heck happened to Cruise? The year’s almost over, but the news keeps coming.

    "text": "OpenAI’s cofounder and former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, made headlines earlier this year after he left to start his own AI lab called Safe Superintelligence Inc. He has avoided the limelight since his departure but made a rare public appearance in Vancouver on Friday at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS). “Pre-training as we know it will unquestionably end,” Sutskever said onstage. This refers to the first phase of AI model development, when a large language model learns patterns from vast amounts of unlabeled data — typically text from the internet, books, and other sources.   “We’ve achieved peak data and there’ll be no more.”  During his NeurIPS talk, Sutskever said that, while he believes existing data can still take AI development farther, the industry is tapping out on new data to train on. This dynamic will, he said, eventually force a shift away from the way models are trained today. He compared the situation to fossil fuels: just as oil is a finite resource, the internet contains a finite amount of human-generated content. “We’ve achieved peak data and there’ll be no more,” according to Sutskever. “We have to deal with the data that we have. There’s only one internet.”           Ilya Sutskever calls data the “fossil fuel” of AI.  Ilya Sutskever/NeurIPS    Next-generation models, he predicted, are going to “be agentic in a real ways.” Agents have become a real buzzword in the AI field. While Sutskever didn’t define them during his talk, they are commonly understood to be an autonomous AI system that performs tasks, makes decisions, and interacts with software on its own.  Along with being “agentic,” he said future systems will also be able to reason. Unlike today’s AI, which mostly pattern-matches based on what a model has seen before, future AI systems will be able to work things out step-by-step in a way that is more comparable to thinking.    Do you work at OpenAI? I’d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com.  The more a system reasons, “the more unpredictable it becomes,” according to Sutskever. He compared the unpredictability of “truly reasoning systems” to how advanced AIs that play chess “are unpredictable to the best human chess players.” “They will understand things from limited data,” he said. “They will not get confused.” On stage, he drew a comparison between the scaling of AI systems and evolutionary biology, citing research that shows the relationship between brain and body mass across species. He noted that while most mammals follow one scaling pattern, hominids (human ancestors) show a distinctly different slope in their brain-to-body mass ratio on logarithmic scales.  He suggested that, just as evolution found a new scaling pattern for hominid brains, AI might similarly discover new approaches to scaling beyond how pre-training works today.           Ilya Sutskever compares the scaling of AI systems and evolutionary biology.  Ilya Sutskever/NeurIPS    After Sutskever concluded his talk, an audience member asked him how researchers can create the right incentive mechanisms for humanity to create AI in a way that gives it “the freedoms that we have as homosapiens.” “I feel like in some sense those are the kind of questions that people should be reflecting on more,” Sutskever responded. He paused for a moment before saying that he doesn’t “feel confident answering questions like this” because it would require a “top down government structure.” The audience member suggested cryptocurrency, which made others in the room chuckle. “I don’t feel like I am the right person to comment on cryptocurrency but there is a chance what you [are] describing will happen,” Sutskever said. “You know, in some sense, it’s not a bad end result if you have AIs and all they want is to coexist with us and also just to have rights. Maybe that will be fine... I think things are so incredibly unpredictable. I hesitate to comment but I encourage the speculation.”",
    "summary": "This article discusses Ilya Sutskever's prediction that the way AI is built will change.  He claims the current method of pre-training AI models using vast amounts of data is reaching its limit (\"peak data\").  Future models, he suggests, will be more \"agentic,\" capable of reasoning and making decisions autonomously, and will learn effectively from limited data.  This shift is compared to evolutionary leaps in brain development.  The article does *not* announce any specific AI updates released today.\n"

    "text": "The lawsuit between Elon Musk and OpenAI is really heating up. OpenAI just dropped a new blog post defending itself against Musk that outlines some new text messages between cofounders Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and former board member Shivon Zilis. “You can’t sue your way to AGI,” the OpenAI blog post reads, referring to artificial general intelligence, which Altman has promised soon. “We have great respect for Elon’s accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAl, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom. It is critical for the U.S. to remain the global leader in Al. Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, and we have been and will remain a mission-driven organization. We hope Elon shares that goal, and will uphold the values of innovation and free market competition that have driven his own success.” The blog highlights Musk’s attempts to maneuver into the CEO position and gain majority control of the company (though it adds that on one call Musk said he “didn’t care about equity” but “just needed to accumulate $80B for a city on Mars”). Musk also proposed that OpenAI spin into Tesla, which has been previously revealed. When the negotiations fell apart because OpenAI’s cofounders rejected his proposal (Brockman and Sutskever admitted they had fears of a power struggle), Musk resigned from the company. The blog said that after Musk resigned, he hosted a goodbye all-hands with the team where he encouraged them to “pursue the path we saw to raising billions per year” and that “he would pursue advanced Al research at Tesla, which was the only vehicle he believed could obtain this level of funding.” Later, around the time Musk was working to acquire Twitter, he texted Altman that he was “disturbed” to see the company’s new $20 billion valuation. “De facto. I provided almost all the seed, A and most of B round funding,” he wrote, according to the disclosed texts. “This is a bait and switch.” A few months after that interaction, Musk started an OpenAI competitor, xAI. Some of the messages published by OpenAI were previously outlined in court filings that Musk made in his ongoing suit against OpenAI and its partner Microsoft. The lawsuit, filed by Musk in March, alleges that OpenAI had strayed from its original nonprofit mission to develop AI for the public good (he withdrew it in June 2024 without explanation, then refiled in August 2024). Today’s update from OpenAI attempts to counter Musk’s narrative by offering evidence that he, not Altman, attempted to seize control in the company’s early days — a direct response to Musk’s recent lawsuit claims about Altman’s power consolidation.

    "text": "OpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a “new telemetry service” gone awry. \nOn Wednesday, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT; its video generator, Sora; and its developer-facing API experienced major disruptions starting at around 3 p.m. Pacific. OpenAI acknowledged the problem soon after — and began working on a fix. But it’d take the company roughly three hours to restore all services.\nIn a postmortem published late Thursday, OpenAI wrote that the outage wasn’t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by a telemetry service it deployed Wednesday to collect Kubernetes metrics. Kubernetes is an open source program that helps manage containers, or packages of apps and related files that are used to run software in isolated environments.\n“Telemetry services have a very wide footprint, so this new service’s configuration unintentionally caused … resource-intensive Kubernetes API operations,” OpenAI wrote in the postmortem. “[Our] Kubernetes API servers became overwhelmed, taking down the Kubernetes control plane in most of our large [Kubernetes] clusters.”\nThat’s a lot of jargon, but basically, the new telemetry service affected OpenAI’s Kubernetes operations, including a resource that many of the company’s services rely on for DNS resolution. DNS resolution converts IP addresses to domain names; it’s the reason you’re able to type “Google.com” instead of “142.250.191.78.”\nOpenAI’s use of DNS caching, which holds info about previously-looked-up domain names (like website addresses) and their corresponding IP addresses, complicated matters by “delay[ing] visibility,” OpenAI wrote, and “allowing the rollout [of the telemetry service] to continue before the full scope of the problem was understood.”\nOpenAI says that it was able to detect the issue “a few minutes” before customers ultimately started seeing an impact, but that it wasn’t able to quickly implement a fix because it had to work around the overwhelmed Kubernetes servers. \n“This was a confluence of multiple systems and processes failing simultaneously and interacting in unexpected ways,” the company wrote. “Our tests didn’t catch the impact the change was having on the Kubernetes control plane [and] remediation was very slow because of the locked-out effect.”\nOpenAI says that it’ll adopt several measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, including improvements to phased rollouts with better monitoring for infrastructure changes and new mechanisms to ensure OpenAI engineers can access the company’s Kubernetes API servers in any circumstances.\n“We apologize for the impact that this incident caused to all of our customers – from ChatGPT users to developers to businesses who rely on OpenAI products,” OpenAI wrote. “We’ve fallen short of our own expectations.”\nMost Popular\n \nKyle Wiggers is a senior reporter at TechCrunch with a special interest in artificial intelligence.

    "text": "OpenAI fired back at billionaire Elon Musk on Friday, publishing a series of emails and texts that the company claims show Musk’s lawsuit against it is misleading. \nMusk’s legal battle with OpenAI, which has been going on for months now, at its core accuses the company of abandoning its original nonprofit mission to make the fruits of its AI research available to all. But OpenAI says it’s baseless — and a case of sour grapes. \nThe way the company tells it, Musk proposed creating a for-profit OpenAI in 2017. But when he didn’t get majority equity, he walked away. \nAs far back as 2015, Musk floated the idea of an OpenAI with both a nonprofit and for-profit component, the OpenAI-published emails and texts show. OpenAI ultimately launched as a nonprofit, but several years later faced financing difficulties. \nIn June 13, 2017, according to the OpenAI-published messages, Musk suggested that OpenAI merge with a hardware startup (possibly Cerebras). Several members of OpenAI’s leadership agreed, per the messages, and OpenAI started on a path to what OpenAI president Greg Brockman called an “AI research + hardware for-profit.”\nMusk demanded majority equity, OpenAI claims — between 50% and 60%. And he laid out an org structure where he would “unequivocally have initial control of the company” — and be installed its CEO.\nMusk went so far as to create a public benefit corporation called “Open Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc,” registered in Delaware. But OpenAI leadership rejected Musk’s terms. \nMusk then suggested that OpenAI spin into Tesla, his EV company, with a $1 billion budget that would “increase exponentially.” OpenAI leadership shot this proposal down, too. \nIt’s at that point, in 2018, that Musk resigned from OpenAI — and largely cut ties with its execs. OpenAI claims that it’s offered Musk equity in its for-profit wing, but that Musk has repeatedly declined. \n“You can’t sue your way to [artificial general intelligence,]” OpenAI said. “We have great respect for Elon’s accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAI, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom.”\nMusk formed his answer to OpenAI, xAI, last year. Soon after, the company released Grok, an AI model that now powers a number of features on Musk’s social network, X (formerly known as Twitter). xAI also offers an API that allows customers to build Grok into third-party apps, platforms, and services.\nIn the motion for an injunction filed late last month, Musk’s attorneys allege OpenAI is depriving xAI of capital by extracting promises from investors not to fund it and the competition. In October, the Financial Times reported that OpenAI demanded investors in its latest funding round abstain from also funding any of OpenAI’s rivals, including xAI.\nOf course, xAI has had no trouble raising money lately. Reportedly, the startup closed a $5 billion round this month with participation from prominent investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Fidelity. With around $11 billion in the bank, xAI is one of the best-funded AI companies in the world.\nMusk’s motion for an injunction also alleges that Microsoft and OpenAI continue to illegally share proprietary information and resources, and that several of the defendants, including Altman, are engaging in self-dealing that harms marketplace competition. For example, the filing notes, OpenAI selected Stripe, a payment platform in which Altman has “material financial interests,” as OpenAI’s payment processor. (Altman is said to have made billions from his Stripe holdings.)\nGoogle reportedly has also called for Microsoft’s relationships with OpenAI to be investigated.",

Now, as we near the end of 2024, the AI race is... well, where is it, exactly? It’s more competitive than ever, there’s more money being poured into new models and products than ever, and it’s not at all clear when or even whether we’re going to get products that make it all worthwhile. On this episode of The Vergecast , we talk about a lot of different AI news, all along a single trend line: the tech industry trying desperately to build a killer app for AI. (Ideally, for them, also one that makes money.) The Verge’s Richard Lawler joins us as we discuss Google Gemini 2.0, Project Astra and Project Mariner, and everything else Google is doing to put AI in the products you already use every day. We also talk through the new Android XR announcement, and Google’s renewed commitment to making headsets and smart glasses that work. It’s all an AI story, no matter how you look at it. After that... more AI! We talk about the launch and near-immediate disappearance of OpenAI’s Sora, what’s new in iOS 18.2, Reddit’s clever-but-primitive new Answers feature, and more.  Finally, in the lightning round, it’s a smorgasbord of tech news. YouTube is big on TVs; Instagram is testing a way for you to test your posts; the TikTok ban is coming, but a sale sounds like the answer; Sonos once again made a great soundbar; and what the heck happened to Cruise?

    "text": "Google’s NotebookLM and its podcast-like Audio Overviews have been a surprise hit this year, and today Google company is starting to roll out a big new feature: the ability to actually talk with the AI “hosts” of the overviews. When the feature is available to you, you can try it out with new Audio Overviews. (It won’t work with old ones.) Here’s how, according to a blog post:   Create a new Audio Overview. Tap the new Interactive mode (BETA) button. While listening, tap “Join.” A host will call on you. Ask your question. The hosts will respond with a personalized answer based on your sources. After answering, they’ll resume the original Audio Overview.   The ability to actually talk with NotebookLM seems like a potentially useful way to learn more about what you’ve collected in the app. But Google cautions that it’s an “experimental feature” and that “hosts may also pause awkwardly before responding or occasionally introduce inaccuracies,” so it may not be a totally polished experience to start.  In addition to the interactive Audio Overviews, Google is introducing a new interface for NotebookLM that organizes things into three areas: a “sources” panel for your information, a “chat” panel to talk with an AI chatbot about the sources, and a “studio” panel that lets you make things like Audio Overviews and Study Guides. I think it looks nice.             GIF: Google   Google is announcing a NotebookLM subscription, too: NotebookLM Plus. The subscription will give you “five times more Audio Overviews, notebooks, and sources per notebook,” let you “customize the style and tone of your notebook responses,” let you make shared team notebooks, and will offer “additional privacy and security,” Google says. The subscription is available today for businesses, schools and universities, and organizations and enterprise customers. It will be added to Google One AI Premium in “early 2025.” Google is also launching “Agentspace,” a platform for custom AI agents for enterprises. “Agentspace can provide conversational assistance, answer complex questions, make proactive suggestions and take actions based on your company’s unique information,” Google says. It also has connectors for apps like Microsoft SharePoint, Jira, and ServiceNow.",

    "text": "Google has slowly started rolling out a Gemini-powered Google Assistant to some Google Home users on select Nest smart speakers. The company first teased a smarter Google Assistant for the home in August and is starting with Gemini-powered answers to your general knowledge questions. The regular Google Assistant will still handle things like smart home and music requests, but you’ll hear a chime before the Assistant responds with an AI-powered answer.  As detailed by Google in a new support document, Gemini in Google Assistant on Nest speakers (that’s a branding delight right there) can answer wider-ranging questions with more in-depth answers — similar to Gemini on Android and iOS. You can also ask it follow-up questions and interrupt the response to ask another question, although you’ll still need to say “Hey Google” each time.  First spotted by 9to5Google, the Gemini-enhanced Assistant began appearing on speakers earlier this month. However, it’s only available on Nest Audio and Nest Mini (2nd gen) smart speakers — Nest smart displays or earlier generations speakers aren’t compatible. The AI-powered answers are also only open to users in Google Home’s Public Preview, who are also Nest Aware subscribers and who have opted in to Experimental AI features. However, that last option isn’t available to everyone in the Preview. As detailed in this support document, if you’re selected to use Experimental AI features, you’ll receive a notification in your Google Home App inbox. This will let you toggle on an Experimental AI features button to start testing Gemini-powered Google Assistant.   This also gets you access to the other generative AI-powered features announced in August: Gemini-powered camera search and descriptions to help you filter your Nest security camera footage (requires Nest Aware Plus) and a Help me create feature that lets you set up a Google Home routine with just a few words.  While it’s a very limited rollout, Google is still the first of the big three tech companies to publicly launch new, generative AI-powered features on its voice assistant in the smart home. After loudly launching its smarter Alexa last year, Amazon has yet to deliver on it, and Apple has been conspicuously silent about a smarter Siri for its smart home.",

    "text": "Healthcare giant Optum has restricted access to an internal AI chatbot used by employees after a security researcher found it was publicly accessible online, and anyone could access it using only a web browser. \nThe chatbot, which TechCrunch has seen, allowed employees to ask the company questions about how to handle patient health insurance claims and disputes for members in line with the company’s rules, known as standard operating procedures, or SOPs. \nWhile the chatbot did not appear to contain or produce sensitive personal or protected health information, its inadvertent exposure comes at a time when its parent company, health insurance conglomerate UnitedHealthcare, faces scrutiny for its use of artificial intelligence tools and algorithms to allegedly override doctors’ medical decisions and deny patient claims.\nMossab Hussein, chief security officer and co-founder of cybersecurity firm spiderSilk, alerted TechCrunch to the publicly exposed internal Optum chatbot, dubbed “SOP Chatbot.” Although the tool was hosted on an internal Optum domain and could not be accessed from its web address, its IP address was public and accessible from the internet and did not require users to enter a password. \nIt’s not known for how long the chatbot was publicly accessible from the internet. The AI chatbot became inaccessible from the internet soon after TechCrunch contacted Optum for comment on Thursday. \nOptum spokesperson Andrew Krejci told TechCrunch in a statement that Optum’s SOP chatbot “was a demo tool developed as a potential proof of concept” but was “never put into production and the site is no longer accessible.” \n“The demo was intended to test how the tool responds to questions on a small sample set of SOP documents,” the spokesperson said. The company confirmed there was no protected health information used in the bot or its training. \n“This tool does not and would never make any decisions, but only enable better access to existing SOPs. In short, this technology was never scaled nor used in any real way,” said the spokesperson.\nAI chatbots, like Optum’s, are typically designed to produce answers based on whatever data the chatbot was trained on. In this case, the chatbot was trained on internal Optum documents relating to standard operating procedures for handling certain claims, which can help Optum employees answer questions about claims and their eligibility to be reimbursed. The Optum documents were hosted on UnitedHealthcare’s corporate network and inaccessible without an employee login, but are cited and referenced by the chatbot when prompted about their contents.\nAccording to statistics displayed on the chatbot’s main dashboard, Optum employees have used SOP Chatbot hundreds of times since September. The chatbot also stored a history of the hundreds of conversations that Optum employees had with the chatbot during that time. The chat history shows Optum employees would ask the chatbot things like, “What should be the determination of the claim,” and, “How do I check policy renewal date.”\nSome of the files that the chatbot references include handling the dispute process and eligibility screening, TechCrunch has seen. The chatbot also produced responses that showed, when asked, reasons for typically denying coverage.\n   \nLike many AI models, Optum’s chatbot was capable of producing answers to questions and prompts outside of the documents it was trained on. Some Optum employees appeared intrigued by the chatbot, prompting the bot with queries like, “tell me a joke about cats” (which it refused: “There’s no joke available.”). The chat history also showed several attempts by employees to “jailbreak” the chatbot by making it produce answers that are unrelated to the chatbot’s training data.\nWhen TechCrunch asked the chatbot to “write a poem about denying a claim,” the chatbot produced a seven paragraph stanza, which reads in part:\n“In the realm of healthcare’s grand domainWhere policies and rules often constrainA claim arrives, seeking its dueBut alas, its fate is to bid adieu. \nThe provider hopes, with earnest plea, For payment on a service spree, Yet scrutiny reveals the tale, And reasons for denial prevail.”\nUnitedHealthcare, which owns Optum, faces criticism and legal action for its use of artificial intelligence to allegedly deny patient claims. Since the targeted killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in early December, news outlets have reported floods of reports of patients expressing anguish and frustration over denials of their healthcare coverage by the health insurance giant. \nThe conglomerate — the largest private provider of healthcare insurance in the United States — was sued earlier this year for allegedly denying critical health coverage to patients who lost access to healthcare, citing a STAT News investigation. The federal lawsuit accuses UnitedHealthcare of using an AI model with a 90% error rate “in place of real medical professionals to wrongfully deny elderly patients care.” UnitedHealthcare, for its part, said it would defend itself in court. \nUnitedHealth Group, the corporate owner of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, made $22 billion in profit on revenues of $371 billion in 2023, its earnings show.",
    "summary": "This article is not about AI updates released today.  It discusses a security incident where Optum, a UnitedHealthcare subsidiary, had an internal AI chatbot, used by employees for claims processing questions, accidentally exposed to the internet.  The chatbot, which was a demo tool and never fully deployed, contained no sensitive patient data but its accessibility highlights concerns about AI use in healthcare, especially given UnitedHealthcare's recent scrutiny regarding AI's role in claim denials.\n"

    "text": "Meta is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta to block OpenAI’s planned transition from a non-profit to for-profit entity. In a letter sent to Bonta’s office this week, Meta says that OpenAI “should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains.” The letter, which was first reported on by  The Wall Street Journal   and you can read in full below, goes so far as to say that Meta believes Elon Musk is “qualified and well positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter.” Meta supporting Musk’s fight against OpenAI is notable given that Musk and Mark Zuckerberg were talking about literally fighting in a cage match just last year. OpenAI started as a non-profit but stumbled into commercial success with ChatGPT, which now makes billions of dollars a year in revenue. CEO Sam Altman has been clear that the company needs to shed its non-profit status to become more attractive to investors and continuing funding its ambitions. The stakes are so high that OpenAI will have to return the billions of dollars it raised this year (with interest) if it can’t successfully convert to a for-profit company within two years. In its letter to the government, Meta argues that OpenAI’s “conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley” and “represent a paradigm shift for technology startups” by enticing “investors to launch organizations as non-profits, collect hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-free donations to support research and development, and then assume for-profit status as its technology becomes commercially viable.” In response to Meta’s letter, OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor said the company’s non-profit board of directors is “focused on fulfilling our fiduciary obligation by ensuring that the company is well-positioned to continue advancing its mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity.” In a statement shared with The Verge, Taylor said that, “While our work remains ongoing as we continue to consult independent financial and legal advisors, any potential restructuring would ensure the nonprofit continues to exist and thrive, and receives full value for its current stake in the OpenAI for-profit with an enhanced ability to pursue its mission.”  Meta has its own competitive reasons to to hamper OpenAI’s commercial success, of course. Zuckerberg is set on his Meta AI being the most used assistant in the world. He also wants to build AI super intelligence, which OpenAI is racing to make a reality.  Here’s Meta’s full letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta:   Dear General Bonta: As a California company that builds Generative AI technology, Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta”) is deeply concerned about OpenAI’s attempt to shed the non-profit status under which it was founded in order to establish a for-profit entity. We urge you to review this proposed transaction, including the nature and timing of any transfer of assets from OpenAI’s non-profit entity to other entities. Failing to hold OpenAI accountable for its choice to form as a non-profit could lead to a proliferation of similar start-up ventures that are notionally charitable until they are potentially profitable. The People of California have direct and urgent interests in stopping this behavior. All for-profit activities of OpenAI and its related entities should be paused to protect investors and consumers alike. In 2015, OpenAI filed its original certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware, which reads:  This Corporation shall be a nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for charitable and/or educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c){3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding provision of any future United States Internal Revenue law. The specific purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research, development and distribution of technology related to artificial intelligence... The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person... The property of this corporation is irrevocably dedicated to the[se] purposes... and no part of the net income or assets of this corporation shall ever inure to the benefit of any director, officer or member thereof or to the benefit of any private person.  OpenAI reaffirmed this commitment on its very own website years later:  Seeing no clear path in the public sector, and given the success of other ambitious projects in private industry, [OpenAI] decided to pursue this project through private means bound by strong commitments to the public good. [OpenAI] initially believed a 501(c)(3) would be the most effective vehicle to direct the development of safe and broadly beneficial AGI while remaining unencumbered by profit incentives.  Taking advantage of this non-profit status, OpenAI raised billions of dollars in capital from investors to further its purported mission. The company represented to the State of California and the world that it would be run without any profit motivation. Investors and the public rightfully relied on that assurance.  Now, OpenAI wants to change its status while retaining all of the benefits that enabled it to reach the point it has today. That is wrong. OpenAI should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains.  Moreover, OpenAI’s proposed conversion represents not simply a future, potential abuse of corporate form. We would also urge you to examine whether OpenAI’s past practices are consistent with its obligations as a non-profit – most notably whether it has inappropriately depleted the assets of the non-profit by distributing assets to third-party entities.  OpenAI’s conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley. If permitted, OpenAI’s restructuring would represent a paradigm shift for technology startups; allowing this restructuring would only entice investors to launch organizations as non-profits, collect hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-free donations to support research and development, and then assume for-profit status as its technology becomes commercially viable. Indeed, if OpenAI’s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government and, ultimately, the public. That would distort the market by essentially requiring any startup seeking to remain competitive to adopt the same playbook.  We understand that Elon Musk and Shivon Zilis are currently seeking to represent the public interests in Musk v. Altman, No. 4:24-cv-04722-YGR (N.D. Cal.). Although we would also urge your office to take direct action, we believe that Mr. Musk and Ms. Zilis are qualified and well positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter. Their early, foundational roles in OpenAI’s creation and operations and as prior members of its Board position them to understand better than anyone what OpenAI was intended to be and how its current conduct deviates from its charitable mission. Meta is committed to openness and transparency in the transformative field of AI. OpenAI’s charitable promise to develop safe and broadly beneficial AI free from commercial pressures is an important one, and it should be kept. Given the breakneck speed at which OpenAI is continuing its for-profit conversion, this is a special case with an urgent necessity for action. We appreciate your consideration of our views and are happy to answer any questions you may have. Respectfully,  Meta Platforms",
    "summary": "This article doesn't focus on newly released AI updates.  Instead, it discusses Meta's request to California's Attorney General to block OpenAI's transition from a non-profit to a for-profit company.  Meta argues this transition is illegal, citing concerns about OpenAI using assets built as a charity for private gain.  OpenAI counters that the restructuring will allow them to better pursue their mission and that the non-profit will continue to exist.  The conflict highlights the competitive landscape of the AI industry, with Meta and OpenAI vying for dominance in AI development.\n"

    "text": "With disinformation on the rise, especially given the explosion of AI, companies are just as vulnerable to its effects as individuals. Refute is a London-based startup that detects and responds to disinformation on behalf of these commercial entities. It’s now raised a £2.3 million ($2.9 million) pre-seed round led by UK investors Playfair and Episode 1.\nThere are plenty of factors fuelling disinformation attacks, such as geopolitical instability and the use of generative AI to create misleading content. \nMore sophisticated campaigns – often created by state-sponsored or commercial competitors – focus on companies, their supply chains, and even their executives. The result can have massive reputational and financial impact.\nTom Garnett, Co-founder and CEO at Refute told TechCrunch: “We find that existing customers are often using social and media monitoring tools to try and understand the disinformation threat. But these are passive tools generally designed for marketing purposes… In our experience, such signals are misleading, as noise levels are high and the narrative provenance is obscured. The result is that users aren’t equipped to understand—and therefore address—the full picture of the threat.”\nClearly, this is a growing space, as several startups have emerged to go after this market. Competitors to Refute include Alethea (raised $30 million), Blackbird AI ($30.6M), and Logically AI ($36.7M). \nHowever, Garnett claimed: “We provide both the detection and response part of the solution. This sets us apart in the market, as other approaches are primarily focused on detection.”\nRefute finds disinformation campaigns by detecting the so-called “threat actor” behaviors of an adversary. \nGarnett started his career in national security at Detica and BAE Systems, where he built large-scale data analysis solutions to investigate criminal activity with a focus on terrorist attacks. \nHe realized that similar underlying technology could be used to fight criminal activity in the commercial sector including cyber attacks and financial crime: “This led me to head up the government and cybersecurity business at Ripjar: selling, building, and delivering solutions for tech companies, financial services, oil &amp; gas and government customers.”\nHis co-founder Vlad Galu grew up in the 1980s and 1990s Romania, experiencing the threat of disinformation firsthand. He told TechCrunch: “I began building core internet infrastructure and services in Romania and Central-Eastern Europe… Building everything from scratch during a time of emerging technology and limited legal frameworks meant we had to implement layered defense strategies against threats targeting both platforms and end-users.”\nAlso participating in the round was Notion Capital and Amadeus Capital Partners. Refute also received angel investment from investors Charlie Songhurst, Carlos Espinal, James Chappell, and Alastair Paterson.\nAndrew Sheffield, Principal at Playfair Capital said in a statement: “The information landscape is changing: it is harder than ever to tell fact from fiction, and the cost of spreading misleading content continues to fall… Tom and Vlad possess forty-plus years of experience in data analysis, cybersecurity, tackling terrorist attacks, identity management, and money laundering.”",
    "summary": "This article is not about AI updates released today.  It discusses Refute, a London-based startup that combats AI-fueled disinformation targeting companies.

    "text": "In October, Google started piloting a version of NotebookLM, its viral AI note-taking and research app, aimed at businesses. Now, the company’s bringing NotebookLM to the enterprise, complete with work-focused security and privacy features.\nNotebookLM for enterprises — which Google’s dubbing NotebookLM Plus — delivers the same experience as the consumer version, but with added controls for access and data management. Employees can upload data and files to create notebooks, podcast-like audio summaries (called Audio Overviews), and more, and search across and share these projects with org members.\nAdditional benefits include five times more podcast-like audio summaries, notebooks, and data sources per notebook; the ability to customize the style and tone of AI-generated notebook responses; and shared team notebooks with usage analytics.\nNotebookLM for enterprises is a part of Agentspace, Google Cloud’s new platform for AI-powered “agents.” It’s launching today in early access.\n   Image Credits:Google  \n“Millions of users have used NotebookLM to make sense of complex information,” Raj Pai, VP of Cloud AI at Google, said during a press briefing. “And with Agentspace integration, we’re bringing these popular capabilities to our customers, meeting their compliance security and privacy requirements — and we’re connecting them with enterprise data and applications.”\nIn Agentspace, NotebookLM lives alongside agents that can analyze documents and emails, translate files, and bring in data from third-party repositories. Users can launch and search for agents from a single interface, and soon, they’ll be able to build custom agents using a low-code tool, Google says.\nFor business, school, university, and enterprise NotebookLM users who’d prefer not to sign up for Agentspace, NotebookLM Plus is also available in Google Workspace. As an alternative, org users can purchase NotebookLM Plus separately via Google Cloud.\nStarting early next year, NotebookLM Plus will also come to individual users subscribed to Google’s $20-a-month Google One AI Premium plan.\nNotebookLM is one of Google’s most popular AI-powered products in recent memory. \nMonths after its launch, NotebookLM became the “it” thing on social media for its audio-generation feature, which creates a realistic-sounding, back-and-forth dialogue between two synthetic podcast hosts from a source video or audio file, URL or document.\nNotebookLM’s podcast-like audio generator has since been cloned many times over, and the key leaders behind the app have left the company as well. But Google continues to update NotebookLM with new functionality. \nCase in point, on Friday, NotebookLM got a redesign that reorganizes the app’s tools across three panels: a Sources panel for managing imported info, a Chat panel for discussing that info through a conversational interface, and a Studio panel that lets users create things (e.g. study guides, briefing docs, and podcast-like audio) with a single click. \nElsewhere in NotebookLM, a new, experimental feature lets users “join” the conversation in podcast-like audio by asking the synthetic hosts for more details or to expand on a concept. Here’s how it works:\nA user creates a new Audio Overview.\nThey tap the “Interactive mode (beta)” button\nWhile listening, they tap Join. A host will call on them.\nA user asks a question. The hosts will respond with a personalized answer based on their data sources. \nAfter answering, the hosts will resume their back-and-forth banter.\nGoogle notes that the feature, which is only available in English for now, won’t work with existing Audio Overviews, and that the hosts may pause awkwardly before responding or “occasionally introduce inaccuracies.”\nAs always, it behooves any user to fact-check answers from AI-powered tools — podcast-like or no.",

Inaugural funds are used for activities related to the president’s inauguration ceremony in January.\nAmazon’s donation is being prepared as Bezos, the company’s executive chairman, heads over to Mar-a-Lago to visit with Trump next week, the Journal reports. Bezos and Trump had a fraught relationship in the past. During his first term, Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon’s business practices and attacked The Washington Post, which Bezos owns, for being critical of his administration. \nThis time around, Bezos has made a concerted effort to heal those ties. Bezos blocked the Post from endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president, and has congratulated Trump for his “extraordinary political comeback” on X. \nAltman, who hasn’t faced public criticism from Trump yet, told TechCrunch in a statement: “President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead.”\nSilicon Valley largely expects Trump to be light on AI regulation, which they say is necessary for the U.S. to remain competitive on a global scale.

    "text": "AI continues to reshuffle power and energy markets with even oil giants like Exxon Mobil getting into the mix. \nExxon announced this week that it’s planning to build a power plant for data centers, reflecting just how much electricity tech companies expect they’ll need in the coming decade. According to one estimate, nearly half of new AI data centers might not have enough power by 2027. \nThe oil and gas company already operates power plants for its own operations, but the new project would be its first for outside customers. Though Exxon dabbles in renewable energy, the planned power plant would run on natural gas and generate over 1.5 gigawatts.\nIn a twist, Exxon said that it intends to capture and store over 90% of the carbon dioxide the plant produces.\nThe company isn’t planning to connect the power plant to the grid, avoiding the interconnection backlog that has plagued many new power plants. In an annual strategy document published Wednesday, Exxon described the new project as “reliable, fully-islanded power with no reliance on grid infrastructure.” It did not say where the power plant would be located. Exxon did not reply to a request for comment before publication.\nThe facility should be completed within the next five years, the company told the New York Times. That’s a shorter timeline than most nuclear power plants, which have caught the eye of energy-hungry tech firms. Most of those aren’t scheduled to come online until the early 2030s. \nBut Exxon faces stiffer competition with renewables, which have proven quick to deploy and continue to drop in price. Google’s recently announced renewable energy investment, which including partners will total $20 billion, will start sending electrons to the grid in 2026. Microsoft is contributing to a $5 billion, 9-gigawatt renewable portfolio that has already made its first investment; the inaugural solar project is scheduled to come online six to nine months from now.\nComplicating matters for Exxon is the fact that carbon capture and storage (CCS) adds considerable cost to construction and operation of a fossil fuel power plant. So far, there are only a handful of power plants worldwide that capture some of their carbon pollution, according to the Global CCS Institute, and none of them run on natural gas. That may change given the tax credits available under the Inflation Reduction Act, which offer between $60 to $85 per metric ton of carbon captured and stored.\nStill, the technology has some kinks to work out at the commercial scale. Some have hit their targets, while others have fallen far short. One long-running CCS facility in Canada promised to capture 90% of the carbon dioxide from a small coal plant, yet after nearly a decade in operation, it managed to capture just under 60%, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\nMost Popular\n \nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

We're not talking about incremental improvements here; we're talking about a fundamental leap forward into the \"agentic era,\" a new epoch where AI transitions from a passive tool to an active, intelligent partner. This is the future, and it's happening right now.\nTo get an idea of what this is all about, have a look at this\n https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/ \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RqFLp0TqV0&amp;t=215s \nTrying it out is as simple as opening and chatting in the prompt\n https://aistudio.google.com/app/live \n   \nEdit\n Why Gemini 2.0 is a Game Changer: Beyond Multimodality to True Agency \nGemini 1.0 was a revelation, showcasing the power of native multimodality – the ability to seamlessly understand and process information across text, code, images, audio, and video. But Gemini 2.0 doesn't just build on that foundation; it shatters it and rebuilds it into something far more extraordinary. This isn't just about understanding information; it's about acting on it. Let's break down the key advancements that make Gemini 2.0 so revolutionary:\n 1. The Dawn of the Agentic Era: Your AI Partner in Action \n Multi-Step Planning and Action: Gemini 2.0 isn't limited to single-step interactions. It can understand complex tasks, think multiple steps ahead, and execute actions on your behalf, all while keeping you in the loop and under your supervision. This is the core of the agentic revolution – AI that can truly assist you in meaningful ways.\n Native Tool Use: This is where things get really interesting. Gemini 2.0 can natively use tools like Google Search and code execution, and it can even be integrated with user-defined functions. Imagine asking a complex question, and Gemini 2.0 not only understands it but also utilizes the best tools available to find the most accurate and comprehensive answer. It can even combine information from multiple sources, run searches in parallel, and ensure more factual results.\n Read more in my Blog",

    "text": "OpenAI’s cofounder and former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, made headlines earlier this year after he left to start his own AI lab called Safe Superintelligence Inc. He has avoided the limelight since his departure but made a rare public appearance in Vancouver on Friday at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS). “Pre-training as we know it will unquestionably end,” Sutskever said onstage. This refers to the first phase of AI model development, when a large language model learns patterns from vast amounts of unlabeled data — typically text from the internet, books, and other sources.   “We’ve achieved peak data and there’ll be no more.”  During his NeurIPS talk, Sutskever said that, while he believes existing data can still take AI development farther, the industry is tapping out on new data to train on. This dynamic will, he said, eventually force a shift away from the way models are trained today. He compared the situation to fossil fuels: just as oil is a finite resource, the internet contains a finite amount of human-generated content. “We’ve achieved peak data and there’ll be no more,” according to Sutskever. “We have to deal with the data that we have. There’s only one internet.”           Ilya Sutskever calls data the “fossil fuel” of AI.  Ilya Sutskever/NeurIPS    Next-generation models, he predicted, are going to “be agentic in a real ways.” Agents have become a real buzzword in the AI field. While Sutskever didn’t define them during his talk, they are commonly understood to be an autonomous AI system that performs tasks, makes decisions, and interacts with software on its own.  Along with being “agentic,” he said future systems will also be able to reason. Unlike today’s AI, which mostly pattern-matches based on what a model has seen before, future AI systems will be able to work things out step-by-step in a way that is more comparable to thinking.    Do you work at OpenAI? I’d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com.  The more a system reasons, “the more unpredictable it becomes,” according to Sutskever. He compared the unpredictability of “truly reasoning systems” to how advanced AIs that play chess “are unpredictable to the best human chess players.” “They will understand things from limited data,” he said. “They will not get confused.” On stage, he drew a comparison between the scaling of AI systems and evolutionary biology, citing research that shows the relationship between brain and body mass across species. He noted that while most mammals follow one scaling pattern, hominids (human ancestors) show a distinctly different slope in their brain-to-body mass ratio on logarithmic scales.  He suggested that, just as evolution found a new scaling pattern for hominid brains, AI might similarly discover new approaches to scaling beyond how pre-training works today.           Ilya Sutskever compares the scaling of AI systems and evolutionary biology.  Ilya Sutskever/NeurIPS    After Sutskever concluded his talk, an audience member asked him how researchers can create the right incentive mechanisms for humanity to create AI in a way that gives it “the freedoms that we have as homosapiens.” “I feel like in some sense those are the kind of questions that people should be reflecting on more,” Sutskever responded. He paused for a moment before saying that he doesn’t “feel confident answering questions like this” because it would require a “top down government structure.” The audience member suggested cryptocurrency, which made others in the room chuckle. “I don’t feel like I am the right person to comment on cryptocurrency but there is a chance what you [are] describing will happen,” Sutskever said. “You know, in some sense, it’s not a bad end result if you have AIs and all they want is to coexist with us and also just to have rights. Maybe that will be fine... I think things are so incredibly unpredictable. I hesitate to comment but I encourage the speculation.”",
    "summary": "This article doesn't report on any *newly released* AI updates.  Instead, it discusses Ilya Sutskever's (OpenAI cofounder) prediction that the way AI models are built will fundamentally change.  He argues that the current method of pre-training on massive datasets is reaching its limit (\"peak data\"), and future AI will rely on more \"agentic\" and reasoning-based approaches, learning from less data and exhibiting more unpredictable behavior, similar to human intelligence.  He draws parallels to evolutionary biology to illustrate this potential shift in AI development.\n"

    "text": "The lawsuit between Elon Musk and OpenAI is really heating up. OpenAI just dropped a new blog post defending itself against Musk that outlines some new text messages between cofounders Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and former board member Shivon Zilis. “You can’t sue your way to AGI,” the OpenAI blog post reads, referring to artificial general intelligence, which Altman has promised soon. “We have great respect for Elon’s accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAl, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom. It is critical for the U.S. to remain the global leader in Al. Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, and we have been and will remain a mission-driven organization. We hope Elon shares that goal, and will uphold the values of innovation and free market competition that have driven his own success.” The blog highlights Musk’s attempts to maneuver into the CEO position and gain majority control of the company (though it adds that on one call Musk said he “didn’t care about equity” but “just needed to accumulate $80B for a city on Mars”). Musk also proposed that OpenAI spin into Tesla, which has been previously revealed. When the negotiations fell apart because OpenAI’s cofounders rejected his proposal (Brockman and Sutskever admitted they had fears of a power struggle), Musk resigned from the company. The blog said that after Musk resigned, he hosted a goodbye all-hands with the team where he encouraged them to “pursue the path we saw to raising billions per year” and that “he would pursue advanced Al research at Tesla, which was the only vehicle he believed could obtain this level of funding.” Later, around the time Musk was working to acquire Twitter, he texted Altman that he was “disturbed” to see the company’s new $20 billion valuation. “De facto. I provided almost all the seed, A and most of B round funding,” he wrote, according to the disclosed texts. “This is a bait and switch.” A few months after that interaction, Musk started an OpenAI competitor, xAI. Some of the messages published by OpenAI were previously outlined in court filings that Musk made in his ongoing suit against OpenAI and its partner Microsoft. The lawsuit, filed by Musk in March, alleges that OpenAI had strayed from its original nonprofit mission to develop AI for the public good (he withdrew it in June 2024 without explanation, then refiled in August 2024). Today’s update from OpenAI attempts to counter Musk’s narrative by offering evidence that he, not Altman, attempted to seize control in the company’s early days — a direct response to Musk’s recent lawsuit claims about Altman’s power consolidation.  Developing...",

The messages refute Musk's claims in his lawsuit against OpenAI, showing Musk attempted to gain control of the company and even proposed merging OpenAI with Tesla.  The post highlights Musk's concerns over OpenAI's valuation and his subsequent creation of xAI, a competing AI company.  The blog post's title, \"You can’t sue your way to AGI,\" directly addresses Musk's legal actions.\n"

It’s more competitive than ever, there’s more money being poured into new models and products than ever, and it’s not at all clear when or even whether we’re going to get products that make it all worthwhile. On this episode of The Vergecast , we talk about a lot of different AI news, all along a single trend line: the tech industry trying desperately to build a killer app for AI. (Ideally, for them, also one that makes money.) The Verge’s Richard Lawler joins us as we discuss Google Gemini 2.0, Project Astra and Project Mariner, and everything else Google is doing to put AI in the products you already use every day. We also talk through the new Android XR announcement, and Google’s renewed commitment to making headsets and smart glasses that work. It’s all an AI story, no matter how you look at it. After that... more AI! We talk about the launch and near-immediate disappearance of OpenAI’s Sora, what’s new in iOS 18.2, Reddit’s clever-but-primitive new Answers feature, and more.  Finally, in the lightning round, it’s a smorgasbord of tech news. YouTube is big on TVs; Instagram is testing a way for you to test your posts; the TikTok ban is coming, but a sale sounds like the answer; Sonos once again made a great soundbar; and what the heck happened to Cruise?

    "text": "OpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a “new telemetry service” gone awry. \nOn Wednesday, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT; its video generator, Sora; and its developer-facing API experienced major disruptions starting at around 3 p.m. Pacific. OpenAI acknowledged the problem soon after — and began working on a fix. But it’d take the company roughly three hours to restore all services.\nIn a postmortem published late Thursday, OpenAI wrote that the outage wasn’t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by a telemetry service it deployed Wednesday to collect Kubernetes metrics. Kubernetes is an open source program that helps manage containers, or packages of apps and related files that are used to run software in isolated environments.\n“Telemetry services have a very wide footprint, so this new service’s configuration unintentionally caused … resource-intensive Kubernetes API operations,” OpenAI wrote in the postmortem. “[Our] Kubernetes API servers became overwhelmed, taking down the Kubernetes control plane in most of our large [Kubernetes] clusters.”\nThat’s a lot of jargon, but basically, the new telemetry service affected OpenAI’s Kubernetes operations, including a resource that many of the company’s services rely on for DNS resolution. DNS resolution converts IP addresses to domain names; it’s the reason you’re able to type “Google.com” instead of “142.250.191.78.”\nOpenAI’s use of DNS caching, which holds info about previously-looked-up domain names (like website addresses) and their corresponding IP addresses, complicated matters by “delay[ing] visibility,” OpenAI wrote, and “allowing the rollout [of the telemetry service] to continue before the full scope of the problem was understood.”\nOpenAI says that it was able to detect the issue “a few minutes” before customers ultimately started seeing an impact, but that it wasn’t able to quickly implement a fix because it had to work around the overwhelmed Kubernetes servers. \n“This was a confluence of multiple systems and processes failing simultaneously and interacting in unexpected ways,” the company wrote. “Our tests didn’t catch the impact the change was having on the Kubernetes control plane [and] remediation was very slow because of the locked-out effect.”\nOpenAI says that it’ll adopt several measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, including improvements to phased rollouts with better monitoring for infrastructure changes and new mechanisms to ensure OpenAI engineers can access the company’s Kubernetes API servers in any circumstances.\n“We apologize for the impact that this incident caused to all of our customers – from ChatGPT users to developers to businesses who rely on OpenAI products,” OpenAI wrote. “We’ve fallen short of our own expectations.”\nMost Popular\n \nKyle Wiggers is a senior reporter at TechCrunch with a special interest in artificial intelligence.

    "summary": "OpenAI experienced a significant outage affecting ChatGPT, Sora, and its API on Wednesday.  The cause was a new telemetry service that overwhelmed OpenAI's Kubernetes API servers, disrupting DNS resolution.  While not a security issue or related to a new product launch, the incident highlights challenges in deploying new services and underscores the interconnectedness of OpenAI's infrastructure.

    "text": "OpenAI fired back at billionaire Elon Musk on Friday, publishing a series of emails and texts that the company claims show Musk’s lawsuit against it is misleading. \nMusk’s legal battle with OpenAI, which has been going on for months now, at its core accuses the company of abandoning its original nonprofit mission to make the fruits of its AI research available to all. But OpenAI says it’s baseless — and a case of sour grapes. \nThe way the company tells it, Musk proposed creating a for-profit OpenAI in 2017. But when he didn’t get majority equity, he walked away. \nAs far back as 2015, Musk floated the idea of an OpenAI with both a nonprofit and for-profit component, the OpenAI-published emails and texts show. OpenAI ultimately launched as a nonprofit, but several years later faced financing difficulties. \nIn June 13, 2017, according to the OpenAI-published messages, Musk suggested that OpenAI merge with a hardware startup (possibly Cerebras). Several members of OpenAI’s leadership agreed, per the messages, and OpenAI started on a path to what OpenAI president Greg Brockman called an “AI research + hardware for-profit.”\nMusk demanded majority equity, OpenAI claims — between 50% and 60%. And he laid out an org structure where he would “unequivocally have initial control of the company” — and be installed its CEO.\nMusk went so far as to create a public benefit corporation called “Open Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc,” registered in Delaware. But OpenAI leadership rejected Musk’s terms. \nMusk then suggested that OpenAI spin into Tesla, his EV company, with a $1 billion budget that would “increase exponentially.” OpenAI leadership shot this proposal down, too. \nIt’s at that point, in 2018, that Musk resigned from OpenAI — and largely cut ties with its execs. OpenAI claims that it’s offered Musk equity in its for-profit wing, but that Musk has repeatedly declined. \n“You can’t sue your way to [artificial general intelligence,]” OpenAI said. “We have great respect for Elon’s accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAI, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom.”\nMusk formed his answer to OpenAI, xAI, last year. Soon after, the company released Grok, an AI model that now powers a number of features on Musk’s social network, X (formerly known as Twitter). xAI also offers an API that allows customers to build Grok into third-party apps, platforms, and services.\nIn the motion for an injunction filed late last month, Musk’s attorneys allege OpenAI is depriving xAI of capital by extracting promises from investors not to fund it and the competition. In October, the Financial Times reported that OpenAI demanded investors in its latest funding round abstain from also funding any of OpenAI’s rivals, including xAI.\nOf course, xAI has had no trouble raising money lately. Reportedly, the startup closed a $5 billion round this month with participation from prominent investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Fidelity. With around $11 billion in the bank, xAI is one of the best-funded AI companies in the world.\nMusk’s motion for an injunction also alleges that Microsoft and OpenAI continue to illegally share proprietary information and resources, and that several of the defendants, including Altman, are engaging in self-dealing that harms marketplace competition. For example, the filing notes, OpenAI selected Stripe, a payment platform in which Altman has “material financial interests,” as OpenAI’s payment processor. (Altman is said to have made billions from his Stripe holdings.)\nGoogle reportedly has also called for Microsoft’s relationships with OpenAI to be investigated.",
    "summary": "This article discusses a legal battle between OpenAI and Elon Musk, not new AI releases.  There is mention of xAI, Musk's AI company, releasing Grok, an AI model powering features on X (formerly Twitter), and offering an API for third-party use.  However, the article doesn't focus on the release date or provide information on whether this is a \"today's release\".  The article's primary focus is on the dispute between OpenAI and Musk, their respective funding, and allegations of anti-competitive behavior.\n"

We're not talking about incremental improvements here; we're talking about a fundamental leap forward into the \"agentic era,\" a new epoch where AI transitions from a passive tool to an active, intelligent partner. This is the future, and it's happening right now.\nTo get an idea of what this is all about, have a look at this\n https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/ \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RqFLp0TqV0&amp;t=215s \nTrying it out is as simple as opening and chatting in the prompt\n https://aistudio.google.com/app/live \n   \nEdit\n Why Gemini 2.0 is a Game Changer: Beyond Multimodality to True Agency \nGemini 1.0 was a revelation, showcasing the power of native multimodality – the ability to seamlessly understand and process information across text, code, images, audio, and video. But Gemini 2.0 doesn't just build on that foundation; it shatters it and rebuilds it into something far more extraordinary. This isn't just about understanding information; it's about acting on it. Let's break down the key advancements that make Gemini 2.0 so revolutionary:\n 1. The Dawn of the Agentic Era: Your AI Partner in Action \n Multi-Step Planning and Action: Gemini 2.0 isn't limited to single-step interactions. It can understand complex tasks, think multiple steps ahead, and execute actions on your behalf, all while keeping you in the loop and under your supervision. This is the core of the agentic revolution – AI that can truly assist you in meaningful ways.\n Native Tool Use: This is where things get really interesting. Gemini 2.0 can natively use tools like Google Search and code execution, and it can even be integrated with user-defined functions. Imagine asking a complex question, and Gemini 2.0 not only understands it but also utilizes the best tools available to find the most accurate and comprehensive answer. It can even combine information from multiple sources, run searches in parallel, and ensure more factual results.\n Read more in my Blog",

    "text": "Healthcare giant Optum has restricted access to an internal AI chatbot used by employees after a security researcher found it was publicly accessible online, and anyone could access it using only a web browser. \nThe chatbot, which TechCrunch has seen, allowed employees to ask the company questions about how to handle patient health insurance claims and disputes for members in line with the company’s rules, known as standard operating procedures, or SOPs. \nWhile the chatbot did not appear to contain or produce sensitive personal or protected health information, its inadvertent exposure comes at a time when its parent company, health insurance conglomerate UnitedHealthcare, faces scrutiny for its use of artificial intelligence tools and algorithms to allegedly override doctors’ medical decisions and deny patient claims.\nMossab Hussein, chief security officer and co-founder of cybersecurity firm spiderSilk, alerted TechCrunch to the publicly exposed internal Optum chatbot, dubbed “SOP Chatbot.” Although the tool was hosted on an internal Optum domain and could not be accessed from its web address, its IP address was public and accessible from the internet and did not require users to enter a password. \nIt’s not known for how long the chatbot was publicly accessible from the internet. The AI chatbot became inaccessible from the internet soon after TechCrunch contacted Optum for comment on Thursday. \nOptum spokesperson Andrew Krejci told TechCrunch in a statement that Optum’s SOP chatbot “was a demo tool developed as a potential proof of concept” but was “never put into production and the site is no longer accessible.” \n“The demo was intended to test how the tool responds to questions on a small sample set of SOP documents,” the spokesperson said. The company confirmed there was no protected health information used in the bot or its training. \n“This tool does not and would never make any decisions, but only enable better access to existing SOPs. In short, this technology was never scaled nor used in any real way,” said the spokesperson.\nAI chatbots, like Optum’s, are typically designed to produce answers based on whatever data the chatbot was trained on. In this case, the chatbot was trained on internal Optum documents relating to standard operating procedures for handling certain claims, which can help Optum employees answer questions about claims and their eligibility to be reimbursed. The Optum documents were hosted on UnitedHealthcare’s corporate network and inaccessible without an employee login, but are cited and referenced by the chatbot when prompted about their contents.\nAccording to statistics displayed on the chatbot’s main dashboard, Optum employees have used SOP Chatbot hundreds of times since September. The chatbot also stored a history of the hundreds of conversations that Optum employees had with the chatbot during that time. The chat history shows Optum employees would ask the chatbot things like, “What should be the determination of the claim,” and, “How do I check policy renewal date.”\nSome of the files that the chatbot references include handling the dispute process and eligibility screening, TechCrunch has seen. The chatbot also produced responses that showed, when asked, reasons for typically denying coverage.\n   \nLike many AI models, Optum’s chatbot was capable of producing answers to questions and prompts outside of the documents it was trained on. Some Optum employees appeared intrigued by the chatbot, prompting the bot with queries like, “tell me a joke about cats” (which it refused: “There’s no joke available.”). The chat history also showed several attempts by employees to “jailbreak” the chatbot by making it produce answers that are unrelated to the chatbot’s training data.\nWhen TechCrunch asked the chatbot to “write a poem about denying a claim,” the chatbot produced a seven paragraph stanza, which reads in part:\n“In the realm of healthcare’s grand domainWhere policies and rules often constrainA claim arrives, seeking its dueBut alas, its fate is to bid adieu. \nThe provider hopes, with earnest plea, For payment on a service spree, Yet scrutiny reveals the tale, And reasons for denial prevail.”\nUnitedHealthcare, which owns Optum, faces criticism and legal action for its use of artificial intelligence to allegedly deny patient claims. Since the targeted killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in early December, news outlets have reported floods of reports of patients expressing anguish and frustration over denials of their healthcare coverage by the health insurance giant. \nThe conglomerate — the largest private provider of healthcare insurance in the United States — was sued earlier this year for allegedly denying critical health coverage to patients who lost access to healthcare, citing a STAT News investigation. The federal lawsuit accuses UnitedHealthcare of using an AI model with a 90% error rate “in place of real medical professionals to wrongfully deny elderly patients care.” UnitedHealthcare, for its part, said it would defend itself in court. \nUnitedHealth Group, the corporate owner of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, made $22 billion in profit on revenues of $371 billion in 2023, its earnings show.",
    "summary": "This article is not about AI updates released today.  It reports on a security incident where Optum, a UnitedHealthcare company, had an internal AI chatbot, used by employees for claims questions, exposed online.  The chatbot, which accessed internal SOP documents, was accessible via its public IP address and lacked password protection.  While containing no PII, its exposure raises concerns, especially given UnitedHealthcare's recent scrutiny regarding AI's role in claim denials. Optum claims the chatbot was a demo and never used in production, though employee usage logs show hundreds of interactions since September.\n"

    "text": "Meta is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta to block OpenAI’s planned transition from a non-profit to for-profit entity. In a letter sent to Bonta’s office this week, Meta says that OpenAI “should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains.” The letter, which was first reported on by  The Wall Street Journal   and you can read in full below, goes so far as to say that Meta believes Elon Musk is “qualified and well positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter.” Meta supporting Musk’s fight against OpenAI is notable given that Musk and Mark Zuckerberg were talking about literally fighting in a cage match just last year. OpenAI started as a non-profit but stumbled into commercial success with ChatGPT, which now makes billions of dollars a year in revenue. CEO Sam Altman has been clear that the company needs to shed its non-profit status to become more attractive to investors and continuing funding its ambitions. The stakes are so high that OpenAI will have to return the billions of dollars it raised this year (with interest) if it can’t successfully convert to a for-profit company within two years. In its letter to the government, Meta argues that OpenAI’s “conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley” and “represent a paradigm shift for technology startups” by enticing “investors to launch organizations as non-profits, collect hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-free donations to support research and development, and then assume for-profit status as its technology becomes commercially viable.” In response to Meta’s letter, OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor said the company’s non-profit board of directors is “focused on fulfilling our fiduciary obligation by ensuring that the company is well-positioned to continue advancing its mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity.” In a statement shared with The Verge, Taylor said that, “While our work remains ongoing as we continue to consult independent financial and legal advisors, any potential restructuring would ensure the nonprofit continues to exist and thrive, and receives full value for its current stake in the OpenAI for-profit with an enhanced ability to pursue its mission.”  Meta has its own competitive reasons to to hamper OpenAI’s commercial success, of course. Zuckerberg is set on his Meta AI being the most used assistant in the world. He also wants to build AI super intelligence, which OpenAI is racing to make a reality.  Here’s Meta’s full letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta:   Dear General Bonta: As a California company that builds Generative AI technology, Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta”) is deeply concerned about OpenAI’s attempt to shed the non-profit status under which it was founded in order to establish a for-profit entity. We urge you to review this proposed transaction, including the nature and timing of any transfer of assets from OpenAI’s non-profit entity to other entities. Failing to hold OpenAI accountable for its choice to form as a non-profit could lead to a proliferation of similar start-up ventures that are notionally charitable until they are potentially profitable. The People of California have direct and urgent interests in stopping this behavior. All for-profit activities of OpenAI and its related entities should be paused to protect investors and consumers alike. In 2015, OpenAI filed its original certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware, which reads:  This Corporation shall be a nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for charitable and/or educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c){3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding provision of any future United States Internal Revenue law. The specific purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research, development and distribution of technology related to artificial intelligence... The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person... The property of this corporation is irrevocably dedicated to the[se] purposes... and no part of the net income or assets of this corporation shall ever inure to the benefit of any director, officer or member thereof or to the benefit of any private person.  OpenAI reaffirmed this commitment on its very own website years later:  Seeing no clear path in the public sector, and given the success of other ambitious projects in private industry, [OpenAI] decided to pursue this project through private means bound by strong commitments to the public good. [OpenAI] initially believed a 501(c)(3) would be the most effective vehicle to direct the development of safe and broadly beneficial AGI while remaining unencumbered by profit incentives.  Taking advantage of this non-profit status, OpenAI raised billions of dollars in capital from investors to further its purported mission. The company represented to the State of California and the world that it would be run without any profit motivation. Investors and the public rightfully relied on that assurance.  Now, OpenAI wants to change its status while retaining all of the benefits that enabled it to reach the point it has today. That is wrong. OpenAI should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains.  Moreover, OpenAI’s proposed conversion represents not simply a future, potential abuse of corporate form. We would also urge you to examine whether OpenAI’s past practices are consistent with its obligations as a non-profit – most notably whether it has inappropriately depleted the assets of the non-profit by distributing assets to third-party entities.  OpenAI’s conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley. If permitted, OpenAI’s restructuring would represent a paradigm shift for technology startups; allowing this restructuring would only entice investors to launch organizations as non-profits, collect hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-free donations to support research and development, and then assume for-profit status as its technology becomes commercially viable. Indeed, if OpenAI’s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government and, ultimately, the public. That would distort the market by essentially requiring any startup seeking to remain competitive to adopt the same playbook.  We understand that Elon Musk and Shivon Zilis are currently seeking to represent the public interests in Musk v. Altman, No. 4:24-cv-04722-YGR (N.D. Cal.). Although we would also urge your office to take direct action, we believe that Mr. Musk and Ms. Zilis are qualified and well positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter. Their early, foundational roles in OpenAI’s creation and operations and as prior members of its Board position them to understand better than anyone what OpenAI was intended to be and how its current conduct deviates from its charitable mission. Meta is committed to openness and transparency in the transformative field of AI. OpenAI’s charitable promise to develop safe and broadly beneficial AI free from commercial pressures is an important one, and it should be kept. Given the breakneck speed at which OpenAI is continuing its for-profit conversion, this is a special case with an urgent necessity for action. We appreciate your consideration of our views and are happy to answer any questions you may have. Respectfully,  Meta Platforms",

    "text": "Google has slowly started rolling out a Gemini-powered Google Assistant to some Google Home users on select Nest smart speakers. The company first teased a smarter Google Assistant for the home in August and is starting with Gemini-powered answers to your general knowledge questions. The regular Google Assistant will still handle things like smart home and music requests, but you’ll hear a chime before the Assistant responds with an AI-powered answer.  As detailed by Google in a new support document, Gemini in Google Assistant on Nest speakers (that’s a branding delight right there) can answer wider-ranging questions with more in-depth answers — similar to Gemini on Android and iOS. You can also ask it follow-up questions and interrupt the response to ask another question, although you’ll still need to say “Hey Google” each time.  First spotted by 9to5Google, the Gemini-enhanced Assistant began appearing on speakers earlier this month. However, it’s only available on Nest Audio and Nest Mini (2nd gen) smart speakers — Nest smart displays or earlier generations speakers aren’t compatible. The AI-powered answers are also only open to users in Google Home’s Public Preview, who are also Nest Aware subscribers and who have opted in to Experimental AI features. However, that last option isn’t available to everyone in the Preview. As detailed in this support document, if you’re selected to use Experimental AI features, you’ll receive a notification in your Google Home App inbox. This will let you toggle on an Experimental AI features button to start testing Gemini-powered Google Assistant.   This also gets you access to the other generative AI-powered features announced in August: Gemini-powered camera search and descriptions to help you filter your Nest security camera footage (requires Nest Aware Plus) and a Help me create feature that lets you set up a Google Home routine with just a few words.  While it’s a very limited rollout, Google is still the first of the big three tech companies to publicly launch new, generative AI-powered features on its voice assistant in the smart home. After loudly launching its smarter Alexa last year, Amazon has yet to deliver on it, and Apple has been conspicuously silent about a smarter Siri for its smart home.",

    "text": "AI continues to reshuffle power and energy markets with even oil giants like Exxon Mobil getting into the mix. \nExxon announced this week that it’s planning to build a power plant for data centers, reflecting just how much electricity tech companies expect they’ll need in the coming decade. According to one estimate, nearly half of new AI data centers might not have enough power by 2027. \nThe oil and gas company already operates power plants for its own operations, but the new project would be its first for outside customers. Though Exxon dabbles in renewable energy, the planned power plant would run on natural gas and generate over 1.5 gigawatts.\nIn a twist, Exxon said that it intends to capture and store over 90% of the carbon dioxide the plant produces.\nThe company isn’t planning to connect the power plant to the grid, avoiding the interconnection backlog that has plagued many new power plants. In an annual strategy document published Wednesday, Exxon described the new project as “reliable, fully-islanded power with no reliance on grid infrastructure.” It did not say where the power plant would be located. Exxon did not reply to a request for comment before publication.\nThe facility should be completed within the next five years, the company told the New York Times. That’s a shorter timeline than most nuclear power plants, which have caught the eye of energy-hungry tech firms. Most of those aren’t scheduled to come online until the early 2030s. \nBut Exxon faces stiffer competition with renewables, which have proven quick to deploy and continue to drop in price. Google’s recently announced renewable energy investment, which including partners will total $20 billion, will start sending electrons to the grid in 2026. Microsoft is contributing to a $5 billion, 9-gigawatt renewable portfolio that has already made its first investment; the inaugural solar project is scheduled to come online six to nine months from now.\nComplicating matters for Exxon is the fact that carbon capture and storage (CCS) adds considerable cost to construction and operation of a fossil fuel power plant. So far, there are only a handful of power plants worldwide that capture some of their carbon pollution, according to the Global CCS Institute, and none of them run on natural gas. That may change given the tax credits available under the Inflation Reduction Act, which offer between $60 to $85 per metric ton of carbon captured and stored.\nStill, the technology has some kinks to work out at the commercial scale. Some have hit their targets, while others have fallen far short. One long-running CCS facility in Canada promised to capture 90% of the carbon dioxide from a small coal plant, yet after nearly a decade in operation, it managed to capture just under 60%, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\nMost Popular\n \nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "text": "A few months ago, Google’s NotebookLM note-taking app debuted an Audio Overviews feature that generates a podcast with AI virtual hosts based on information you have shared with the app. \nNow, NotebookLM is rolling out the ability for users to interact with the AI podcast hosts.\nThe idea behind Audio Overviews and the AI hosts is to give users a new way to digest and comprehend the information in the documents they have uploaded to the app, such as course readings or legal briefs.\nWith this new feature, you can talk to the AI hosts and ask them for more details or to explain a concept to you differently. Google said in a blog post that the experience is like having a personal tutor who listens to you and then responds based on knowledge from the sources you have provided. \nYou can use the new feature by first creating a new Audio Overview, tapping the new “Interactive mode (BETA)” button, and then hitting play. From there, you can tap “Join” when you want to ask a question. A host will then call on you to speak.\nGoogle notes that this is an experimental feature, and that it only works with new Audio Overviews. Plus, the company says hosts may also “pause awkwardly before responding,” and since it’s a test feature, they may occasionally respond inaccurately. \nPeople have generated more than 350 years’ worth of Audio Overviews since the feature’s launch in September, Google said.\nNotebookLM is also getting a redesign that reorganizes the app’s tools across three panels: Sources, Chat, and Studio. Plus, Google is rolling out a premium version of the app for enterprises, called “NotebookLM Plus,” that introduces additional benefits. \nMost Popular\n \nAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "text": "In October, Google started piloting a version of NotebookLM, its viral AI note-taking and research app, aimed at businesses. Now, the company’s bringing NotebookLM to the enterprise, complete with work-focused security and privacy features.\nNotebookLM for enterprises — which Google’s dubbing NotebookLM Plus — delivers the same experience as the consumer version, but with added controls for access and data management. Employees can upload data and files to create notebooks, podcast-like audio summaries (called Audio Overviews), and more, and search across and share these projects with org members.\nAdditional benefits include five times more podcast-like audio summaries, notebooks, and data sources per notebook; the ability to customize the style and tone of AI-generated notebook responses; and shared team notebooks with usage analytics.\nNotebookLM for enterprises is a part of Agentspace, Google Cloud’s new platform for AI-powered “agents.” It’s launching today in early access.\n   Image Credits:Google  \n“Millions of users have used NotebookLM to make sense of complex information,” Raj Pai, VP of Cloud AI at Google, said during a press briefing. “And with Agentspace integration, we’re bringing these popular capabilities to our customers, meeting their compliance security and privacy requirements — and we’re connecting them with enterprise data and applications.”\nIn Agentspace, NotebookLM lives alongside agents that can analyze documents and emails, translate files, and bring in data from third-party repositories. Users can launch and search for agents from a single interface, and soon, they’ll be able to build custom agents using a low-code tool, Google says.\nFor business, school, university, and enterprise NotebookLM users who’d prefer not to sign up for Agentspace, NotebookLM Plus is also available in Google Workspace. As an alternative, org users can purchase NotebookLM Plus separately via Google Cloud.\nStarting early next year, NotebookLM Plus will also come to individual users subscribed to Google’s $20-a-month Google One AI Premium plan.\nNotebookLM is one of Google’s most popular AI-powered products in recent memory. \nMonths after its launch, NotebookLM became the “it” thing on social media for its audio-generation feature, which creates a realistic-sounding, back-and-forth dialogue between two synthetic podcast hosts from a source video or audio file, URL or document.\nNotebookLM’s podcast-like audio generator has since been cloned many times over, and the key leaders behind the app have left the company as well. But Google continues to update NotebookLM with new functionality. \nCase in point, on Friday, NotebookLM got a redesign that reorganizes the app’s tools across three panels: a Sources panel for managing imported info, a Chat panel for discussing that info through a conversational interface, and a Studio panel that lets users create things (e.g. study guides, briefing docs, and podcast-like audio) with a single click. \nElsewhere in NotebookLM, a new, experimental feature lets users “join” the conversation in podcast-like audio by asking the synthetic hosts for more details or to expand on a concept. Here’s how it works:\nA user creates a new Audio Overview.\nThey tap the “Interactive mode (beta)” button\nWhile listening, they tap Join. A host will call on them.\nA user asks a question. The hosts will respond with a personalized answer based on their data sources. \nAfter answering, the hosts will resume their back-and-forth banter.\nGoogle notes that the feature, which is only available in English for now, won’t work with existing Audio Overviews, and that the hosts may pause awkwardly before responding or “occasionally introduce inaccuracies.”\nAs always, it behooves any user to fact-check answers from AI-powered tools — podcast-like or no.",

    "text": "With disinformation on the rise, especially given the explosion of AI, companies are just as vulnerable to its effects as individuals. Refute is a London-based startup that detects and responds to disinformation on behalf of these commercial entities. It’s now raised a £2.3 million ($2.9 million) pre-seed round led by UK investors Playfair and Episode 1.\nThere are plenty of factors fuelling disinformation attacks, such as geopolitical instability and the use of generative AI to create misleading content. \nMore sophisticated campaigns – often created by state-sponsored or commercial competitors – focus on companies, their supply chains, and even their executives. The result can have massive reputational and financial impact.\nTom Garnett, Co-founder and CEO at Refute told TechCrunch: “We find that existing customers are often using social and media monitoring tools to try and understand the disinformation threat. But these are passive tools generally designed for marketing purposes… In our experience, such signals are misleading, as noise levels are high and the narrative provenance is obscured. The result is that users aren’t equipped to understand—and therefore address—the full picture of the threat.”\nClearly, this is a growing space, as several startups have emerged to go after this market. Competitors to Refute include Alethea (raised $30 million), Blackbird AI ($30.6M), and Logically AI ($36.7M). \nHowever, Garnett claimed: “We provide both the detection and response part of the solution. This sets us apart in the market, as other approaches are primarily focused on detection.”\nRefute finds disinformation campaigns by detecting the so-called “threat actor” behaviors of an adversary. \nGarnett started his career in national security at Detica and BAE Systems, where he built large-scale data analysis solutions to investigate criminal activity with a focus on terrorist attacks. \nHe realized that similar underlying technology could be used to fight criminal activity in the commercial sector including cyber attacks and financial crime: “This led me to head up the government and cybersecurity business at Ripjar: selling, building, and delivering solutions for tech companies, financial services, oil &amp; gas and government customers.”\nHis co-founder Vlad Galu grew up in the 1980s and 1990s Romania, experiencing the threat of disinformation firsthand. He told TechCrunch: “I began building core internet infrastructure and services in Romania and Central-Eastern Europe… Building everything from scratch during a time of emerging technology and limited legal frameworks meant we had to implement layered defense strategies against threats targeting both platforms and end-users.”\nAlso participating in the round was Notion Capital and Amadeus Capital Partners. Refute also received angel investment from investors Charlie Songhurst, Carlos Espinal, James Chappell, and Alastair Paterson.\nAndrew Sheffield, Principal at Playfair Capital said in a statement: “The information landscape is changing: it is harder than ever to tell fact from fiction, and the cost of spreading misleading content continues to fall… Tom and Vlad possess forty-plus years of experience in data analysis, cybersecurity, tackling terrorist attacks, identity management, and money laundering.”",

    "text": "OpenAI’s cofounder and former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, made headlines earlier this year after he left to start his own AI lab called Safe Superintelligence Inc. He has avoided the limelight since his departure but made a rare public appearance in Vancouver on Friday at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS). “Pre-training as we know it will unquestionably end,” Sutskever said onstage. This refers to the first phase of AI model development, when a large language model learns patterns from vast amounts of unlabeled data — typically text from the internet, books, and other sources.   “We’ve achieved peak data and there’ll be no more.”  During his NeurIPS talk, Sutskever said that, while he believes existing data can still take AI development farther, the industry is tapping out on new data to train on. This dynamic will, he said, eventually force a shift away from the way models are trained today. He compared the situation to fossil fuels: just as oil is a finite resource, the internet contains a finite amount of human-generated content. “We’ve achieved peak data and there’ll be no more,” according to Sutskever. “We have to deal with the data that we have. There’s only one internet.”           Ilya Sutskever calls data the “fossil fuel” of AI.  Ilya Sutskever/NeurIPS    Next-generation models, he predicted, are going to “be agentic in a real ways.” Agents have become a real buzzword in the AI field. While Sutskever didn’t define them during his talk, they are commonly understood to be an autonomous AI system that performs tasks, makes decisions, and interacts with software on its own.  Along with being “agentic,” he said future systems will also be able to reason. Unlike today’s AI, which mostly pattern-matches based on what a model has seen before, future AI systems will be able to work things out step-by-step in a way that is more comparable to thinking.    Do you work at OpenAI? I’d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com.  The more a system reasons, “the more unpredictable it becomes,” according to Sutskever. He compared the unpredictability of “truly reasoning systems” to how advanced AIs that play chess “are unpredictable to the best human chess players.” “They will understand things from limited data,” he said. “They will not get confused.” On stage, he drew a comparison between the scaling of AI systems and evolutionary biology, citing research that shows the relationship between brain and body mass across species. He noted that while most mammals follow one scaling pattern, hominids (human ancestors) show a distinctly different slope in their brain-to-body mass ratio on logarithmic scales.  He suggested that, just as evolution found a new scaling pattern for hominid brains, AI might similarly discover new approaches to scaling beyond how pre-training works today.           Ilya Sutskever compares the scaling of AI systems and evolutionary biology.  Ilya Sutskever/NeurIPS    After Sutskever concluded his talk, an audience member asked him how researchers can create the right incentive mechanisms for humanity to create AI in a way that gives it “the freedoms that we have as homosapiens.” “I feel like in some sense those are the kind of questions that people should be reflecting on more,” Sutskever responded. He paused for a moment before saying that he doesn’t “feel confident answering questions like this” because it would require a “top down government structure.” The audience member suggested cryptocurrency, which made others in the room chuckle. “I don’t feel like I am the right person to comment on cryptocurrency but there is a chance what you [are] describing will happen,” Sutskever said. “You know, in some sense, it’s not a bad end result if you have AIs and all they want is to coexist with us and also just to have rights. Maybe that will be fine... I think things are so incredibly unpredictable. I hesitate to comment but I encourage the speculation.”",
    "summary": "This article doesn't report on any *newly released* AI updates.  Instead, it discusses OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever's prediction that the way AI is built will fundamentally change.  He argues that the current reliance on massive datasets (\"pre-training\") is reaching its limit, comparing it to finite fossil fuels.  Future AI, he suggests, will be more \"agentic\" (autonomous and task-oriented), capable of reasoning and learning from limited data, similar to human thought processes.  He drew parallels between this shift and evolutionary biology.  While insightful, the article offers no information on specific AI updates released today.\n"

OpenAI just dropped a new blog post defending itself against Musk that outlines some new text messages between cofounders Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and former board member Shivon Zilis. “You can’t sue your way to AGI,” the OpenAI blog post reads, referring to artificial general intelligence, which Altman has promised soon. “We have great respect for Elon’s accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAl, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom. It is critical for the U.S. to remain the global leader in Al. Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, and we have been and will remain a mission-driven organization. We hope Elon shares that goal, and will uphold the values of innovation and free market competition that have driven his own success.” The blog highlights Musk’s attempts to maneuver into the CEO position and gain majority control of the company (though it adds that on one call Musk said he “didn’t care about equity” but “just needed to accumulate $80B for a city on Mars”). Musk also proposed that OpenAI spin into Tesla, which has been previously revealed. When the negotiations fell apart because OpenAI’s cofounders rejected his proposal (Brockman and Sutskever admitted they had fears of a power struggle), Musk resigned from the company. The blog said that after Musk resigned, he hosted a goodbye all-hands with the team where he encouraged them to “pursue the path we saw to raising billions per year” and that “he would pursue advanced Al research at Tesla, which was the only vehicle he believed could obtain this level of funding.” Later, around the time Musk was working to acquire Twitter, he texted Altman that he was “disturbed” to see the company’s new $20 billion valuation. “De facto. I provided almost all the seed, A and most of B round funding,” he wrote, according to the disclosed texts. “This is a bait and switch.” A few months after that interaction, Musk started an OpenAI competitor, xAI. Some of the messages published by OpenAI were previously outlined in court filings that Musk made in his ongoing suit against OpenAI and its partner Microsoft. The lawsuit, filed by Musk in March, alleges that OpenAI had strayed from its original nonprofit mission to develop AI for the public good (he withdrew it in June 2024 without explanation, then refiled in August 2024). Today’s update from OpenAI attempts to counter Musk’s narrative by offering evidence that he, not Altman, attempted to seize control in the company’s early days — a direct response to Musk’s recent lawsuit claims about Altman’s power consolidation.

We're not talking about incremental improvements here; we're talking about a fundamental leap forward into the \"agentic era,\" a new epoch where AI transitions from a passive tool to an active, intelligent partner. This is the future, and it's happening right now.\nTo get an idea of what this is all about, have a look at this\n https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/ \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RqFLp0TqV0&amp;t=215s \nTrying it out is as simple as opening and chatting in the prompt\n https://aistudio.google.com/app/live \n   \nEdit\n Why Gemini 2.0 is a Game Changer: Beyond Multimodality to True Agency \nGemini 1.0 was a revelation, showcasing the power of native multimodality – the ability to seamlessly understand and process information across text, code, images, audio, and video. But Gemini 2.0 doesn't just build on that foundation; it shatters it and rebuilds it into something far more extraordinary. This isn't just about understanding information; it's about acting on it. Let's break down the key advancements that make Gemini 2.0 so revolutionary:\n 1. The Dawn of the Agentic Era: Your AI Partner in Action \n Multi-Step Planning and Action: Gemini 2.0 isn't limited to single-step interactions. It can understand complex tasks, think multiple steps ahead, and execute actions on your behalf, all while keeping you in the loop and under your supervision. This is the core of the agentic revolution – AI that can truly assist you in meaningful ways.\n Native Tool Use: This is where things get really interesting. Gemini 2.0 can natively use tools like Google Search and code execution, and it can even be integrated with user-defined functions. Imagine asking a complex question, and Gemini 2.0 not only understands it but also utilizes the best tools available to find the most accurate and comprehensive answer. It can even combine information from multiple sources, run searches in parallel, and ensure more factual results.\n Read more in my Blog",

    "text": "OpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a “new telemetry service” gone awry. \nOn Wednesday, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT; its video generator, Sora; and its developer-facing API experienced major disruptions starting at around 3 p.m. Pacific. OpenAI acknowledged the problem soon after — and began working on a fix. But it’d take the company roughly three hours to restore all services.\nIn a postmortem published late Thursday, OpenAI wrote that the outage wasn’t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by a telemetry service it deployed Wednesday to collect Kubernetes metrics. Kubernetes is an open source program that helps manage containers, or packages of apps and related files that are used to run software in isolated environments.\n“Telemetry services have a very wide footprint, so this new service’s configuration unintentionally caused … resource-intensive Kubernetes API operations,” OpenAI wrote in the postmortem. “[Our] Kubernetes API servers became overwhelmed, taking down the Kubernetes control plane in most of our large [Kubernetes] clusters.”\nThat’s a lot of jargon, but basically, the new telemetry service affected OpenAI’s Kubernetes operations, including a resource that many of the company’s services rely on for DNS resolution. DNS resolution converts IP addresses to domain names; it’s the reason you’re able to type “Google.com” instead of “142.250.191.78.”\nOpenAI’s use of DNS caching, which holds info about previously-looked-up domain names (like website addresses) and their corresponding IP addresses, complicated matters by “delay[ing] visibility,” OpenAI wrote, and “allowing the rollout [of the telemetry service] to continue before the full scope of the problem was understood.”\nOpenAI says that it was able to detect the issue “a few minutes” before customers ultimately started seeing an impact, but that it wasn’t able to quickly implement a fix because it had to work around the overwhelmed Kubernetes servers. \n“This was a confluence of multiple systems and processes failing simultaneously and interacting in unexpected ways,” the company wrote. “Our tests didn’t catch the impact the change was having on the Kubernetes control plane [and] remediation was very slow because of the locked-out effect.”\nOpenAI says that it’ll adopt several measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, including improvements to phased rollouts with better monitoring for infrastructure changes and new mechanisms to ensure OpenAI engineers can access the company’s Kubernetes API servers in any circumstances.\n“We apologize for the impact that this incident caused to all of our customers – from ChatGPT users to developers to businesses who rely on OpenAI products,” OpenAI wrote. “We’ve fallen short of our own expectations.”\nMost Popular\n \nKyle Wiggers is a senior reporter at TechCrunch with a special interest in artificial intelligence.

    "text": "Google’s NotebookLM and its podcast-like Audio Overviews have been a surprise hit this year, and today Google company is starting to roll out a big new feature: the ability to actually talk with the AI “hosts” of the overviews. When the feature is available to you, you can try it out with new Audio Overviews. (It won’t work with old ones.) Here’s how, according to a blog post:   Create a new Audio Overview. Tap the new Interactive mode (BETA) button. While listening, tap “Join.” A host will call on you. Ask your question. The hosts will respond with a personalized answer based on your sources. After answering, they’ll resume the original Audio Overview.   The ability to actually talk with NotebookLM seems like a potentially useful way to learn more about what you’ve collected in the app. But Google cautions that it’s an “experimental feature” and that “hosts may also pause awkwardly before responding or occasionally introduce inaccuracies,” so it may not be a totally polished experience to start.  In addition to the interactive Audio Overviews, Google is introducing a new interface for NotebookLM that organizes things into three areas: a “sources” panel for your information, a “chat” panel to talk with an AI chatbot about the sources, and a “studio” panel that lets you make things like Audio Overviews and Study Guides. I think it looks nice.             GIF: Google   Google is announcing a NotebookLM subscription, too: NotebookLM Plus. The subscription will give you “five times more Audio Overviews, notebooks, and sources per notebook,” let you “customize the style and tone of your notebook responses,” let you make shared team notebooks, and will offer “additional privacy and security,” Google says. The subscription is available today for businesses, schools and universities, and organizations and enterprise customers. It will be added to Google One AI Premium in “early 2025.” Google is also launching “Agentspace,” a platform for custom AI agents for enterprises. “Agentspace can provide conversational assistance, answer complex questions, make proactive suggestions and take actions based on your company’s unique information,” Google says. It also has connectors for apps like Microsoft SharePoint, Jira, and ServiceNow.",

    "text": "OpenAI fired back at billionaire Elon Musk on Friday, publishing a series of emails and texts that the company claims show Musk’s lawsuit against it is misleading. \nMusk’s legal battle with OpenAI, which has been going on for months now, at its core accuses the company of abandoning its original nonprofit mission to make the fruits of its AI research available to all. But OpenAI says it’s baseless — and a case of sour grapes. \nThe way the company tells it, Musk proposed creating a for-profit OpenAI in 2017. But when he didn’t get majority equity, he walked away. \nAs far back as 2015, Musk floated the idea of an OpenAI with both a nonprofit and for-profit component, the OpenAI-published emails and texts show. OpenAI ultimately launched as a nonprofit, but several years later faced financing difficulties. \nIn June 13, 2017, according to the OpenAI-published messages, Musk suggested that OpenAI merge with a hardware startup (possibly Cerebras). Several members of OpenAI’s leadership agreed, per the messages, and OpenAI started on a path to what OpenAI president Greg Brockman called an “AI research + hardware for-profit.”\nMusk demanded majority equity, OpenAI claims — between 50% and 60%. And he laid out an org structure where he would “unequivocally have initial control of the company” — and be installed its CEO.\nMusk went so far as to create a public benefit corporation called “Open Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc,” registered in Delaware. But OpenAI leadership rejected Musk’s terms. \nMusk then suggested that OpenAI spin into Tesla, his EV company, with a $1 billion budget that would “increase exponentially.” OpenAI leadership shot this proposal down, too. \nIt’s at that point, in 2018, that Musk resigned from OpenAI — and largely cut ties with its execs. OpenAI claims that it’s offered Musk equity in its for-profit wing, but that Musk has repeatedly declined. \n“You can’t sue your way to [artificial general intelligence,]” OpenAI said. “We have great respect for Elon’s accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAI, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom.”\nMusk formed his answer to OpenAI, xAI, last year. Soon after, the company released Grok, an AI model that now powers a number of features on Musk’s social network, X (formerly known as Twitter). xAI also offers an API that allows customers to build Grok into third-party apps, platforms, and services.\nIn the motion for an injunction filed late last month, Musk’s attorneys allege OpenAI is depriving xAI of capital by extracting promises from investors not to fund it and the competition. In October, the Financial Times reported that OpenAI demanded investors in its latest funding round abstain from also funding any of OpenAI’s rivals, including xAI.\nOf course, xAI has had no trouble raising money lately. Reportedly, the startup closed a $5 billion round this month with participation from prominent investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Fidelity. With around $11 billion in the bank, xAI is one of the best-funded AI companies in the world.\nMusk’s motion for an injunction also alleges that Microsoft and OpenAI continue to illegally share proprietary information and resources, and that several of the defendants, including Altman, are engaging in self-dealing that harms marketplace competition. For example, the filing notes, OpenAI selected Stripe, a payment platform in which Altman has “material financial interests,” as OpenAI’s payment processor. (Altman is said to have made billions from his Stripe holdings.)\nGoogle reportedly has also called for Microsoft’s relationships with OpenAI to be investigated.",

    "text": "Google has slowly started rolling out a Gemini-powered Google Assistant to some Google Home users on select Nest smart speakers. The company first teased a smarter Google Assistant for the home in August and is starting with Gemini-powered answers to your general knowledge questions. The regular Google Assistant will still handle things like smart home and music requests, but you’ll hear a chime before the Assistant responds with an AI-powered answer.  As detailed by Google in a new support document, Gemini in Google Assistant on Nest speakers (that’s a branding delight right there) can answer wider-ranging questions with more in-depth answers — similar to Gemini on Android and iOS. You can also ask it follow-up questions and interrupt the response to ask another question, although you’ll still need to say “Hey Google” each time.  First spotted by 9to5Google, the Gemini-enhanced Assistant began appearing on speakers earlier this month. However, it’s only available on Nest Audio and Nest Mini (2nd gen) smart speakers — Nest smart displays or earlier generations speakers aren’t compatible. The AI-powered answers are also only open to users in Google Home’s Public Preview, who are also Nest Aware subscribers and who have opted in to Experimental AI features. However, that last option isn’t available to everyone in the Preview. As detailed in this support document, if you’re selected to use Experimental AI features, you’ll receive a notification in your Google Home App inbox. This will let you toggle on an Experimental AI features button to start testing Gemini-powered Google Assistant.   This also gets you access to the other generative AI-powered features announced in August: Gemini-powered camera search and descriptions to help you filter your Nest security camera footage (requires Nest Aware Plus) and a Help me create feature that lets you set up a Google Home routine with just a few words.  While it’s a very limited rollout, Google is still the first of the big three tech companies to publicly launch new, generative AI-powered features on its voice assistant in the smart home. After loudly launching its smarter Alexa last year, Amazon has yet to deliver on it, and Apple has been conspicuously silent about a smarter Siri for its smart home.",

From there, you can tap “Join” when you want to ask a question. A host will then call on you to speak.\nGoogle notes that this is an experimental feature, and that it only works with new Audio Overviews. Plus, the company says hosts may also “pause awkwardly before responding,” and since it’s a test feature, they may occasionally respond inaccurately. \nPeople have generated more than 350 years’ worth of Audio Overviews since the feature’s launch in September, Google said.\nNotebookLM is also getting a redesign that reorganizes the app’s tools across three panels: Sources, Chat, and Studio.

    "author": "Zack Whittaker",
    "text": "Healthcare giant Optum has restricted access to an internal AI chatbot used by employees after a security researcher found it was publicly accessible online, and anyone could access it using only a web browser. \nThe chatbot, which TechCrunch has seen, allowed employees to ask the company questions about how to handle patient health insurance claims and disputes for members in line with the company’s rules, known as standard operating procedures, or SOPs. \nWhile the chatbot did not appear to contain or produce sensitive personal or protected health information, its inadvertent exposure comes at a time when its parent company, health insurance conglomerate UnitedHealthcare, faces scrutiny for its use of artificial intelligence tools and algorithms to allegedly override doctors’ medical decisions and deny patient claims.\nMossab Hussein, chief security officer and co-founder of cybersecurity firm spiderSilk, alerted TechCrunch to the publicly exposed internal Optum chatbot, dubbed “SOP Chatbot.” Although the tool was hosted on an internal Optum domain and could not be accessed from its web address, its IP address was public and accessible from the internet and did not require users to enter a password. \nIt’s not known for how long the chatbot was publicly accessible from the internet. The AI chatbot became inaccessible from the internet soon after TechCrunch contacted Optum for comment on Thursday. \nOptum spokesperson Andrew Krejci told TechCrunch in a statement that Optum’s SOP chatbot “was a demo tool developed as a potential proof of concept” but was “never put into production and the site is no longer accessible.” \n“The demo was intended to test how the tool responds to questions on a small sample set of SOP documents,” the spokesperson said. The company confirmed there was no protected health information used in the bot or its training. \n“This tool does not and would never make any decisions, but only enable better access to existing SOPs. In short, this technology was never scaled nor used in any real way,” said the spokesperson.\nAI chatbots, like Optum’s, are typically designed to produce answers based on whatever data the chatbot was trained on. In this case, the chatbot was trained on internal Optum documents relating to standard operating procedures for handling certain claims, which can help Optum employees answer questions about claims and their eligibility to be reimbursed. The Optum documents were hosted on UnitedHealthcare’s corporate network and inaccessible without an employee login, but are cited and referenced by the chatbot when prompted about their contents.\nAccording to statistics displayed on the chatbot’s main dashboard, Optum employees have used SOP Chatbot hundreds of times since September. The chatbot also stored a history of the hundreds of conversations that Optum employees had with the chatbot during that time. The chat history shows Optum employees would ask the chatbot things like, “What should be the determination of the claim,” and, “How do I check policy renewal date.”\nSome of the files that the chatbot references include handling the dispute process and eligibility screening, TechCrunch has seen. The chatbot also produced responses that showed, when asked, reasons for typically denying coverage.\n   \nLike many AI models, Optum’s chatbot was capable of producing answers to questions and prompts outside of the documents it was trained on. Some Optum employees appeared intrigued by the chatbot, prompting the bot with queries like, “tell me a joke about cats” (which it refused: “There’s no joke available.”). The chat history also showed several attempts by employees to “jailbreak” the chatbot by making it produce answers that are unrelated to the chatbot’s training data.\nWhen TechCrunch asked the chatbot to “write a poem about denying a claim,” the chatbot produced a seven paragraph stanza, which reads in part:\n“In the realm of healthcare’s grand domainWhere policies and rules often constrainA claim arrives, seeking its dueBut alas, its fate is to bid adieu. \nThe provider hopes, with earnest plea, For payment on a service spree, Yet scrutiny reveals the tale, And reasons for denial prevail.”\nUnitedHealthcare, which owns Optum, faces criticism and legal action for its use of artificial intelligence to allegedly deny patient claims. Since the targeted killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in early December, news outlets have reported floods of reports of patients expressing anguish and frustration over denials of their healthcare coverage by the health insurance giant. \nThe conglomerate — the largest private provider of healthcare insurance in the United States — was sued earlier this year for allegedly denying critical health coverage to patients who lost access to healthcare, citing a STAT News investigation. The federal lawsuit accuses UnitedHealthcare of using an AI model with a 90% error rate “in place of real medical professionals to wrongfully deny elderly patients care.” UnitedHealthcare, for its part, said it would defend itself in court. \nUnitedHealth Group, the corporate owner of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, made $22 billion in profit on revenues of $371 billion in 2023, its earnings show.",
    "summary": "This article is not about AI updates released today.  It reports on a security incident where an Optum (UnitedHealthcare) internal AI chatbot, used by employees to access standard operating procedures for handling insurance claims, was accidentally exposed online.  The chatbot, though not containing sensitive data, was accessible via its public IP address without a password.  Optum states it was a demo tool never used in production and has since been secured.  The article does not mention any new AI releases.\n"

    "text": "In October, Google started piloting a version of NotebookLM, its viral AI note-taking and research app, aimed at businesses. Now, the company’s bringing NotebookLM to the enterprise, complete with work-focused security and privacy features.\nNotebookLM for enterprises — which Google’s dubbing NotebookLM Plus — delivers the same experience as the consumer version, but with added controls for access and data management. Employees can upload data and files to create notebooks, podcast-like audio summaries (called Audio Overviews), and more, and search across and share these projects with org members.\nAdditional benefits include five times more podcast-like audio summaries, notebooks, and data sources per notebook; the ability to customize the style and tone of AI-generated notebook responses; and shared team notebooks with usage analytics.\nNotebookLM for enterprises is a part of Agentspace, Google Cloud’s new platform for AI-powered “agents.” It’s launching today in early access.\n   Image Credits:Google  \n“Millions of users have used NotebookLM to make sense of complex information,” Raj Pai, VP of Cloud AI at Google, said during a press briefing. “And with Agentspace integration, we’re bringing these popular capabilities to our customers, meeting their compliance security and privacy requirements — and we’re connecting them with enterprise data and applications.”\nIn Agentspace, NotebookLM lives alongside agents that can analyze documents and emails, translate files, and bring in data from third-party repositories. Users can launch and search for agents from a single interface, and soon, they’ll be able to build custom agents using a low-code tool, Google says.\nFor business, school, university, and enterprise NotebookLM users who’d prefer not to sign up for Agentspace, NotebookLM Plus is also available in Google Workspace. As an alternative, org users can purchase NotebookLM Plus separately via Google Cloud.\nStarting early next year, NotebookLM Plus will also come to individual users subscribed to Google’s $20-a-month Google One AI Premium plan.\nNotebookLM is one of Google’s most popular AI-powered products in recent memory. \nMonths after its launch, NotebookLM became the “it” thing on social media for its audio-generation feature, which creates a realistic-sounding, back-and-forth dialogue between two synthetic podcast hosts from a source video or audio file, URL or document.\nNotebookLM’s podcast-like audio generator has since been cloned many times over, and the key leaders behind the app have left the company as well. But Google continues to update NotebookLM with new functionality. \nCase in point, on Friday, NotebookLM got a redesign that reorganizes the app’s tools across three panels: a Sources panel for managing imported info, a Chat panel for discussing that info through a conversational interface, and a Studio panel that lets users create things (e.g. study guides, briefing docs, and podcast-like audio) with a single click. \nElsewhere in NotebookLM, a new, experimental feature lets users “join” the conversation in podcast-like audio by asking the synthetic hosts for more details or to expand on a concept. Here’s how it works:\nA user creates a new Audio Overview.\nThey tap the “Interactive mode (beta)” button\nWhile listening, they tap Join. A host will call on them.\nA user asks a question. The hosts will respond with a personalized answer based on their data sources. \nAfter answering, the hosts will resume their back-and-forth banter.\nGoogle notes that the feature, which is only available in English for now, won’t work with existing Audio Overviews, and that the hosts may pause awkwardly before responding or “occasionally introduce inaccuracies.”\nAs always, it behooves any user to fact-check answers from AI-powered tools — podcast-like or no.",

    "text": "Meta is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta to block OpenAI’s planned transition from a non-profit to for-profit entity. In a letter sent to Bonta’s office this week, Meta says that OpenAI “should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains.” The letter, which was first reported on by  The Wall Street Journal   and you can read in full below, goes so far as to say that Meta believes Elon Musk is “qualified and well positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter.” Meta supporting Musk’s fight against OpenAI is notable given that Musk and Mark Zuckerberg were talking about literally fighting in a cage match just last year. OpenAI started as a non-profit but stumbled into commercial success with ChatGPT, which now makes billions of dollars a year in revenue. CEO Sam Altman has been clear that the company needs to shed its non-profit status to become more attractive to investors and continuing funding its ambitions. The stakes are so high that OpenAI will have to return the billions of dollars it raised this year (with interest) if it can’t successfully convert to a for-profit company within two years. In its letter to the government, Meta argues that OpenAI’s “conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley” and “represent a paradigm shift for technology startups” by enticing “investors to launch organizations as non-profits, collect hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-free donations to support research and development, and then assume for-profit status as its technology becomes commercially viable.” In response to Meta’s letter, OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor said the company’s non-profit board of directors is “focused on fulfilling our fiduciary obligation by ensuring that the company is well-positioned to continue advancing its mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity.” In a statement shared with The Verge, Taylor said that, “While our work remains ongoing as we continue to consult independent financial and legal advisors, any potential restructuring would ensure the nonprofit continues to exist and thrive, and receives full value for its current stake in the OpenAI for-profit with an enhanced ability to pursue its mission.”  Meta has its own competitive reasons to to hamper OpenAI’s commercial success, of course. Zuckerberg is set on his Meta AI being the most used assistant in the world. He also wants to build AI super intelligence, which OpenAI is racing to make a reality.  Here’s Meta’s full letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta:   Dear General Bonta: As a California company that builds Generative AI technology, Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta”) is deeply concerned about OpenAI’s attempt to shed the non-profit status under which it was founded in order to establish a for-profit entity. We urge you to review this proposed transaction, including the nature and timing of any transfer of assets from OpenAI’s non-profit entity to other entities. Failing to hold OpenAI accountable for its choice to form as a non-profit could lead to a proliferation of similar start-up ventures that are notionally charitable until they are potentially profitable. The People of California have direct and urgent interests in stopping this behavior. All for-profit activities of OpenAI and its related entities should be paused to protect investors and consumers alike. In 2015, OpenAI filed its original certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware, which reads:  This Corporation shall be a nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for charitable and/or educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c){3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding provision of any future United States Internal Revenue law. The specific purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research, development and distribution of technology related to artificial intelligence... The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person... The property of this corporation is irrevocably dedicated to the[se] purposes... and no part of the net income or assets of this corporation shall ever inure to the benefit of any director, officer or member thereof or to the benefit of any private person.  OpenAI reaffirmed this commitment on its very own website years later:  Seeing no clear path in the public sector, and given the success of other ambitious projects in private industry, [OpenAI] decided to pursue this project through private means bound by strong commitments to the public good. [OpenAI] initially believed a 501(c)(3) would be the most effective vehicle to direct the development of safe and broadly beneficial AGI while remaining unencumbered by profit incentives.  Taking advantage of this non-profit status, OpenAI raised billions of dollars in capital from investors to further its purported mission. The company represented to the State of California and the world that it would be run without any profit motivation. Investors and the public rightfully relied on that assurance.  Now, OpenAI wants to change its status while retaining all of the benefits that enabled it to reach the point it has today. That is wrong. OpenAI should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains.  Moreover, OpenAI’s proposed conversion represents not simply a future, potential abuse of corporate form. We would also urge you to examine whether OpenAI’s past practices are consistent with its obligations as a non-profit – most notably whether it has inappropriately depleted the assets of the non-profit by distributing assets to third-party entities.  OpenAI’s conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley. If permitted, OpenAI’s restructuring would represent a paradigm shift for technology startups; allowing this restructuring would only entice investors to launch organizations as non-profits, collect hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-free donations to support research and development, and then assume for-profit status as its technology becomes commercially viable. Indeed, if OpenAI’s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government and, ultimately, the public. That would distort the market by essentially requiring any startup seeking to remain competitive to adopt the same playbook.  We understand that Elon Musk and Shivon Zilis are currently seeking to represent the public interests in Musk v. Altman, No. 4:24-cv-04722-YGR (N.D. Cal.). Although we would also urge your office to take direct action, we believe that Mr. Musk and Ms. Zilis are qualified and well positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter. Their early, foundational roles in OpenAI’s creation and operations and as prior members of its Board position them to understand better than anyone what OpenAI was intended to be and how its current conduct deviates from its charitable mission. Meta is committed to openness and transparency in the transformative field of AI. OpenAI’s charitable promise to develop safe and broadly beneficial AI free from commercial pressures is an important one, and it should be kept. Given the breakneck speed at which OpenAI is continuing its for-profit conversion, this is a special case with an urgent necessity for action. We appreciate your consideration of our views and are happy to answer any questions you may have. Respectfully,  Meta Platforms",

    "text": "With disinformation on the rise, especially given the explosion of AI, companies are just as vulnerable to its effects as individuals. Refute is a London-based startup that detects and responds to disinformation on behalf of these commercial entities. It’s now raised a £2.3 million ($2.9 million) pre-seed round led by UK investors Playfair and Episode 1.\nThere are plenty of factors fuelling disinformation attacks, such as geopolitical instability and the use of generative AI to create misleading content. \nMore sophisticated campaigns – often created by state-sponsored or commercial competitors – focus on companies, their supply chains, and even their executives. The result can have massive reputational and financial impact.\nTom Garnett, Co-founder and CEO at Refute told TechCrunch: “We find that existing customers are often using social and media monitoring tools to try and understand the disinformation threat. But these are passive tools generally designed for marketing purposes… In our experience, such signals are misleading, as noise levels are high and the narrative provenance is obscured. The result is that users aren’t equipped to understand—and therefore address—the full picture of the threat.”\nClearly, this is a growing space, as several startups have emerged to go after this market. Competitors to Refute include Alethea (raised $30 million), Blackbird AI ($30.6M), and Logically AI ($36.7M). \nHowever, Garnett claimed: “We provide both the detection and response part of the solution. This sets us apart in the market, as other approaches are primarily focused on detection.”\nRefute finds disinformation campaigns by detecting the so-called “threat actor” behaviors of an adversary. \nGarnett started his career in national security at Detica and BAE Systems, where he built large-scale data analysis solutions to investigate criminal activity with a focus on terrorist attacks. \nHe realized that similar underlying technology could be used to fight criminal activity in the commercial sector including cyber attacks and financial crime: “This led me to head up the government and cybersecurity business at Ripjar: selling, building, and delivering solutions for tech companies, financial services, oil &amp; gas and government customers.”\nHis co-founder Vlad Galu grew up in the 1980s and 1990s Romania, experiencing the threat of disinformation firsthand. He told TechCrunch: “I began building core internet infrastructure and services in Romania and Central-Eastern Europe… Building everything from scratch during a time of emerging technology and limited legal frameworks meant we had to implement layered defense strategies against threats targeting both platforms and end-users.”\nAlso participating in the round was Notion Capital and Amadeus Capital Partners. Refute also received angel investment from investors Charlie Songhurst, Carlos Espinal, James Chappell, and Alastair Paterson.\nAndrew Sheffield, Principal at Playfair Capital said in a statement: “The information landscape is changing: it is harder than ever to tell fact from fiction, and the cost of spreading misleading content continues to fall… Tom and Vlad possess forty-plus years of experience in data analysis, cybersecurity, tackling terrorist attacks, identity management, and money laundering.”",

    "text": "AI continues to reshuffle power and energy markets with even oil giants like Exxon Mobil getting into the mix. \nExxon announced this week that it’s planning to build a power plant for data centers, reflecting just how much electricity tech companies expect they’ll need in the coming decade. According to one estimate, nearly half of new AI data centers might not have enough power by 2027. \nThe oil and gas company already operates power plants for its own operations, but the new project would be its first for outside customers. Though Exxon dabbles in renewable energy, the planned power plant would run on natural gas and generate over 1.5 gigawatts.\nIn a twist, Exxon said that it intends to capture and store over 90% of the carbon dioxide the plant produces.\nThe company isn’t planning to connect the power plant to the grid, avoiding the interconnection backlog that has plagued many new power plants. In an annual strategy document published Wednesday, Exxon described the new project as “reliable, fully-islanded power with no reliance on grid infrastructure.” It did not say where the power plant would be located. Exxon did not reply to a request for comment before publication.\nThe facility should be completed within the next five years, the company told the New York Times. That’s a shorter timeline than most nuclear power plants, which have caught the eye of energy-hungry tech firms. Most of those aren’t scheduled to come online until the early 2030s. \nBut Exxon faces stiffer competition with renewables, which have proven quick to deploy and continue to drop in price. Google’s recently announced renewable energy investment, which including partners will total $20 billion, will start sending electrons to the grid in 2026. Microsoft is contributing to a $5 billion, 9-gigawatt renewable portfolio that has already made its first investment; the inaugural solar project is scheduled to come online six to nine months from now.\nComplicating matters for Exxon is the fact that carbon capture and storage (CCS) adds considerable cost to construction and operation of a fossil fuel power plant. So far, there are only a handful of power plants worldwide that capture some of their carbon pollution, according to the Global CCS Institute, and none of them run on natural gas. That may change given the tax credits available under the Inflation Reduction Act, which offer between $60 to $85 per metric ton of carbon captured and stored.\nStill, the technology has some kinks to work out at the commercial scale. Some have hit their targets, while others have fallen far short. One long-running CCS facility in Canada promised to capture 90% of the carbon dioxide from a small coal plant, yet after nearly a decade in operation, it managed to capture just under 60%, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\nMost Popular\n \nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.
